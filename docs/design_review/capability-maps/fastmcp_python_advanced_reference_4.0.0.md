# FastMCP in Python — advanced technical reference / feature-category catalog

This reference is designed for **LLM coding agents and engineers who need a source-oriented, implementation-level FastMCP guide**, rather than a quickstart. It preserves the broad architecture and depth of the prior 3.4.7 reference, but the deployable baseline is now **FastMCP 4.0.0 GA**.

## Version / source anchors

**Primary deployable target: `fastmcp==4.0.0`**, released **2026-08-31**. FastMCP 4 is the stable release line, built on the MCP Python SDK v2 and the MCP `2026-07-28` protocol era while retaining negotiation support for earlier handshake-era clients. Python remains **>=3.10**; FastMCP 4 raises important dependency floors including **Pydantic >=2.12**, and server deployments using FastAPI must use a FastAPI version compatible with Starlette 1.x (the official upgrade guide identifies FastAPI >=0.133.0 as the first compatible line). ([PyPI][FM-PYPI]) ([FastMCP 4 Release][FM-RELEASE4]) ([Upgrade 3→4][FM-UPGRADE4])

The documentation site tracks current FastMCP development. Use this precedence when sources disagree:

1. **PyPI / the `v4.0.0` tag and release notes** for the deployable package boundary.
2. **The official FastMCP 4 upgrade guide** for breaking changes from 3.x.
3. **Current FastMCP docs and generated SDK pages** for v4 behavior and signatures.
4. **GitHub changelog/release notes** for patch-level fixes and security changes.
5. **Historical `/v3/` docs** only when documenting migration or deliberately supporting an older runtime.

### Protocol-era rule

FastMCP 4 is not “v3 with a few renamed APIs.” One server can negotiate multiple MCP protocol eras. The modern `2026-07-28` era is **sessionless and self-contained**; older handshake-era clients retain session semantics. This affects elicitation, session state, initialization hooks, logging-level mutation, background tasks, and any design that previously assumed a live server→client callback channel. ([Upgrade 3→4][FM-UPGRADE4])

```text
FastMCP 4 server
    ├─ modern client -> MCP 2026-07-28, sessionless requests
    └─ legacy client -> negotiated handshake-era protocol

Client(mode="auto") -> negotiate best mutual era (default)
Client(mode="legacy") -> pin handshake-era behavior when required
```

## What materially changed from the prior 3.4.7 reference

The earlier document correctly anticipated many v4 concepts in its prerelease section, but FastMCP 4 GA turns those concepts into the main architecture. This revision therefore promotes the following to first-class topics throughout the document:

* protocol-era negotiation and `server/discover`;
* modern stateless request semantics and compatibility with older handshake sessions;
* guard-style multi-round tool interaction via `InputRequiredResult`, `ctx.input_responses`, and sealed `request_state`;
* application session state through `UserSession`, `SessionId`, `SessionProvider`, and `get_session()`;
* the first-class `ServerExtension` / `ClientExtension` API and `FastMCP.add_extension()`;
* background tasks through the `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension and the `fastmcp-tasks` package;
* argument completion through `@mcp.completion`;
* modern auth additions including role checks, identity assertion, insufficient-scope challenges, and client-credentials authentication;
* `ClientGroup` for coordinating independent MCP connections without forcing them behind one proxy/protocol era;
* response-cache and gateway infrastructure hooks, including cache hints and MCP routing headers;
* MCP SDK v2 snake_case Python model fields while retaining camelCase wire aliases;
* `httpx2` as FastMCP's HTTP stack;
* removal of server-side `ctx.sample()`, `ctx.sample_step()`, `ctx.list_roots()`, and `FastMCP(sampling_handler=...)`;
* removal of 3.x deprecated APIs/import shims.

# FastMCP Advanced — 0) Scope, versioning, and mental model
### Scope, versioning, and the FastMCP mental model

**FastMCP 4 status.** The three-surface server/client/apps mental model remains valid, but protocol-era negotiation is now part of the runtime model and current Python MCP model fields are snake_case.


### Version anchors used here

FastMCP’s top-level docs are **not** a frozen release snapshot: the site explicitly says it reflects the `main` branch, version badges mark when a feature was introduced, and unreleased features may already appear in the docs. Separately, the SDK reference is auto-generated from source docstrings and type annotations on every merge to `main`. For agent-authored documentation, that means: treat top-level prose as **forward-looking**, treat version badges as **feature gates**, and treat SDK pages as the highest-confidence source for current call signatures. ([FastMCP][1])

FastMCP also ships unusually agent-friendly docs surfaces: the docs are exposed through an MCP server, available as `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`, and any page can be fetched as markdown by appending `.md`. For LLM programming agents, that materially changes the retrieval strategy: prefer API reference pages for signatures, prose pages for semantics, and the markdown/LLM endpoints for bulk ingestion or offline synthesis. ([FastMCP][1])

### 0.1 Compression of the system model

FastMCP is best modeled as a **three-surface framework**: **Servers** publish MCP capabilities, **Clients** consume them through a deterministic typed interface, and **Apps** add optional interactive UI rendering directly inside the host conversation. The official docs present those three pillars explicitly: servers wrap Python functions into MCP tools/resources/prompts, clients connect to any server with full protocol support, and apps render interactive UIs in-conversation. ([FastMCP][1])

For implementation work, the higher-precision mental model is:

1. **Declaration layer** — Python functions, type hints, docstrings, metadata.
2. **Compilation layer** — FastMCP derives MCP schema, validation rules, descriptions, and component metadata.
3. **Runtime layer** — transport, auth, lifecycle, middleware, session management, routing.
4. **Consumption layer** — a `Client` performs explicit MCP operations.
5. **Optional rendering layer** — app metadata causes tool results to become interactive UIs rather than plain JSON/text. ([FastMCP][1])

That decomposition matters because **Apps are not a separate transport** and **Clients are not a code generator**. Apps are layered on top of server-declared tools; Clients are explicit MCP consumers. The server is still the authoritative source of capability definitions and metadata. ([FastMCP][2])

### 0.2 Surface 1 — Servers

`FastMCP` is the central server object. The docs define it as the container for tools, resources, and prompts, and the constructor is organized into identity, composition, behavior, and handler/storage concerns. At minimum, a server needs a `name`; `instructions` are surfaced to clients/LLMs; `version` defaults to the FastMCP library version if not set. ([FastMCP][2])

Server-side MCP components are semantically distinct:

* **Tools**: invocable functions for action or external-system access.
* **Resources**: passive readable data sources.
* **Prompts**: reusable message templates. ([FastMCP][2])

The crucial authoring invariant is that FastMCP wants **ordinary Python declarations** as the source of truth. For tools specifically, the docs say that declaring a Python function gives you automatic schema, validation, and documentation generation, and that tool execution follows a predictable pipeline: the LLM/client sends arguments, FastMCP validates against the function signature, the function runs, and the result is returned. ([FastMCP][1])

### 0.3 Surface 2 — Clients

`fastmcp.Client` is a **programmatic**, **deterministic**, **explicit** MCP consumer. The docs stress that it is not an autonomous agent runtime; it is a typed interface for controlled interactions with any MCP server. That makes it the correct primitive for integration tests, deterministic orchestration, adapters, evaluators, and higher-level agent frameworks that want MCP transport/auth/protocol handling without surrendering control flow. ([FastMCP][3])

Client construction is intentionally broad: the client can infer transport from an in-process `FastMCP` server, a URL, a local script path, config objects, or transport instances. Entering `async with client:` initializes the MCP session automatically unless `auto_initialize=False` was configured; `initialize()` performs the MCP handshake explicitly and returns capabilities, protocol version, server info, and optional instructions. ([FastMCP][3])

Operationally, the client surface is the “consumer half” of the framework: `ping()`, `list_tools()`, `list_resources()`, `list_prompts()`, `call_tool(...)`, and related methods are the canonical way to validate what the server actually published over transport, as opposed to what the Python module appears to declare locally. ([FastMCP][3])

### 0.4 Surface 3 — Apps

Apps are the optional UI plane. The official overview is explicit: most apps start by adding `app=True` to a tool and returning Prefab components; when the UI needs multiple backend tools with managed visibility and composition safety, use `FastMCPApp`; when full control is required, use custom HTML via the MCP Apps extension. ([FastMCP][4])

The highest-value mental-model compression is: **an app is still a tool result**, but the result carries renderer metadata and `structuredContent` instead of being only plain text or JSON. The architecture docs give the pipeline exactly: **Python components → JSON tree → structuredContent → Renderer iframe → Host UI**. The host loads a renderer in a sandboxed iframe, pushes the structured payload into it, and UI-originated server calls travel back through `postMessage` into normal MCP `tools/call` requests. ([FastMCP][5])

`FastMCPApp` is not just syntactic sugar. It is a provider that binds **entry-point tools** (`@app.ui()`) and **backend tools** (`@app.tool()`), tags them with app identity, manages visibility (`model` vs `app`), and preserves backend-tool resolution even through transforms/namespacing. That is the right abstraction once a UI stops being a single display tool and starts behaving like a composable application. ([FastMCP][6])

### 0.5 Canonical end-to-end flow

#### Stage A — Python declaration

Server declaration begins with `FastMCP(...)`, then component registration with decorators such as `@mcp.tool`, `@mcp.resource(...)`, and `@mcp.prompt`. Minimal server syntax is intentionally small. ([FastMCP][2])

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(
    "DataAnalysis",
    instructions="Provides tools for analyzing numerical datasets. Start with get_summary() for an overview.",
)

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers."""
    return a + b

@mcp.resource("data://config")
def get_config() -> dict:
    return {"theme": "dark", "version": "1.0"}

@mcp.prompt
def analyze_data(data_points: list[float]) -> str:
    return f"Analyze: {data_points}"
```

That skeleton matches the documented minimal constructor and the three primary server component types. ([FastMCP][2])

#### Stage B — MCP schema / validation / docs generation

FastMCP’s value proposition at declaration time is that the Python signature becomes the MCP contract. The docs say the framework auto-generates schema, validation, and documentation from Python functions, and the tool execution flow explicitly validates request parameters against the function signature before your implementation runs. ([FastMCP][1])

For agent authors, the important consequence is: **the Python callable is the canonical schema source**, not a parallel JSON schema file. If your signature, docstring, or return annotation is wrong, the generated MCP contract is wrong. If those are correct, FastMCP will usually out-document a hand-written wrapper because the protocol description remains mechanically aligned with the code. ([FastMCP][1])

#### Stage C — Transport exposure

Publication happens through `mcp.run(...)` or `mcp.http_app()`. `mcp.run()` is synchronous and supports `stdio`, `http`, `sse`, and `streamable-http` transport names; the server docs recommend guarding it with `if __name__ == "__main__":` because MCP clients may launch the server as a subprocess. STDIO is the default; HTTP uses Streamable HTTP; SSE is documented as the legacy/deprecated web transport. ([FastMCP][7])

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # STDIO by default
    # or: mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=9000)
```

This is the documented publication pattern for local subprocess and simple remote deployment. ([FastMCP][2])

#### Stage D — Client invocation

The client consumes the published MCP surface via an explicit async lifecycle. It auto-inferrs transport from the source, initializes on context entry by default, and then exposes MCP operations directly. ([FastMCP][3])

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

async def main():
    async with Client("https://example.com/mcp") as client:
        await client.ping()
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        resources = await client.list_resources()
        prompts = await client.list_prompts()
        result = await client.call_tool("example_tool", {"param": "value"})
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

This matches the documented client usage pattern and is the right reference shape for tests, orchestration code, and adapter layers. ([FastMCP][3])

#### Stage E — Optional interactive UI rendering

A tool becomes an app entry point either by setting `app=True` or by using `FastMCPApp`/`@app.ui()`. For `app=True`, FastMCP can expand that flag into full app metadata, link the tool to the shared renderer resource, and serialize Prefab output into `structuredContent`. If the return annotation is already a Prefab type, FastMCP can auto-wire app metadata even without an explicit `app=True`. ([FastMCP][4])

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp
from prefab_ui.components import Column, Heading

mcp = FastMCP("Dashboard")

@mcp.tool(app=True)
def revenue_chart(year: int) -> PrefabApp:
    with Column() as view:
        Heading(f"Revenue for {year}")
    return PrefabApp(view=view)
```

That is the shortest correct mental model for “tool result renders as UI instead of plain JSON.” ([FastMCP][4])

When the app surface grows beyond a single UI-returning tool, the documented promoted pattern is `FastMCPApp`:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, FastMCPApp
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp

app = FastMCPApp("Notes")

@app.tool()
def add_note(title: str, body: str) -> list[dict]:
    ...

@app.ui()
def notes_app() -> PrefabApp:
    ...

mcp = FastMCP("Notes Server", providers=[app])
```

This is the right abstraction when the model-visible entry point and the UI-only backend tools must remain composition-safe under namespaces and transforms. ([FastMCP][8])

### 0.6 Deployment invariants and best-practice advisory

**Local / desktop / subprocess-hosted MCP**: prefer `mcp.run()` with default STDIO. The running-server docs explicitly position STDIO for local development, Claude Desktop, CLI tools, and single-user applications. Always keep the `__main__` guard for subprocess-launched environments. ([FastMCP][9])

**Remote / multi-client / service deployment**: prefer Streamable HTTP, not SSE. The docs say HTTP transport provides full bidirectional communication, supports all MCP operations including streaming responses, and allows multiple clients to share one server process; SSE is called legacy/deprecated. ([FastMCP][9])

**Production ASGI hosting**: prefer `mcp.http_app()` when you need Uvicorn control, multiple workers, custom middleware, or integration with existing Starlette/FastAPI applications. When mounting, pass `lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan`; the docs are explicit that nested lifespans are not recognized automatically and session management will fail without forwarding FastMCP’s lifespan. ([FastMCP][10])

**Mounted authenticated HTTP deployments**: keep `base_url` and `mcp_path` distinct, and treat `base_url + mcp_path` as the actual externally reachable MCP URL. If the server is OAuth-protected and mounted under a prefix, `.well-known` discovery routes must stay at the root level; FastMCP cannot infer that automatically when the app is mounted under a prefix. ([FastMCP][10])

**Apps in production**: treat the app layer as the fastest-moving surface. The FastMCPApp docs explicitly warn that Prefab is in early active development and can break across releases; pin `prefab-ui` to a specific version. For local previewing, `fastmcp dev apps` provides a browser-based host simulation without needing a real MCP host client. ([FastMCP][8])

### 0.7 Value case, by surface

**Servers** are the leverage surface. Their value is that a normal Python declaration becomes an MCP-compliant capability surface without hand-maintaining parallel schemas, validators, and descriptions. That collapses authoring cost and reduces schema drift. ([FastMCP][1])

**Clients** are the verification and integration surface. Their value is deterministic, typed protocol interaction: exact control over handshake, listings, calls, and lifecycle, suitable for tests and production orchestration rather than only conversational agent loops. ([FastMCP][3])

**Apps** are the presentation surface. Their value is that tool outputs can become usable human interfaces—charts, forms, dashboards, approval steps—without abandoning the MCP model. For simple display, `app=True` is enough; for multi-tool UI systems, `FastMCPApp` adds visibility discipline, stable backend identifiers, and namespace-safe routing. ([FastMCP][4])

### 0.8 Authoring policy for the rest of the documentation set

For all subsequent FastMCP deep dives, use this policy:

* Treat **Python declaration syntax** as the primary contract surface. ([FastMCP][1])
* Treat **SDK reference pages** as the signature source and prose pages as the behavioral source. This follows the docs’ own auto-generation model. ([FastMCP][11])
* Treat **top-level docs as potentially ahead of release**; gate every feature by badge/version, not by page presence alone. ([FastMCP][1])
* Annotate every feature later with at least three dimensions: **introduced version**, **transport scope** (`stdio` vs HTTP vs app-only), and **deployment scope** (local / remote / mounted / auth-sensitive). Those dimensions are repeatedly material in the official docs. ([FastMCP][1])
* For LLM-agent retrieval, prefer **markdown pages**, **llms-full.txt**, or the docs’ own MCP server when building automated synthesis pipelines. ([FastMCP][1])

# FastMCP Advanced — 1) Installation, package selection, dependency policy, and project layout

## 1.0 Release target and dependency policy

This reference targets **FastMCP 4.0.0 GA**, released **2026-08-31**. FastMCP 4 is no longer a prerelease line. Production applications should still pin the exact release they have validated.

```bash
uv add "fastmcp==4.0.0"
# or
python -m pip install "fastmcp==4.0.0"
```

FastMCP 4 is built on MCP `2026-07-28` and MCP Python SDK v2. The normal import namespace remains `fastmcp`. The top-level `fastmcp` distribution is a convenience wrapper around the same-version `fastmcp-slim` core; keep those versions aligned if declared explicitly.

### Dependency floors that matter in v4

The v4 upgrade guide raises several compatibility floors and integration requirements:

* **Pydantic >=2.12**;
* the server/web extra uses the Starlette 1.x generation (the guide calls out **Starlette >=1.0.1**);
* if FastAPI owns the surrounding ASGI app, use a FastAPI version compatible with Starlette 1.x (the guide identifies **FastAPI >=0.133.0** as the first release admitting that range);
* FastMCP's internal HTTP stack is now **`httpx2`**; custom OpenAPI/auth/proxy client factories should use `httpx2.AsyncClient`.

Do not upgrade FastMCP in isolation if your application pins Pydantic, Starlette, FastAPI, or custom HTTP-client types.

## 1.1 Full package, slim package, and optional packages

Normal server/development installation:

```bash
uv add "fastmcp==4.0.0"
```

Client-focused libraries can still use the slim distribution:

```bash
uv add "fastmcp-slim[client]==4.0.0"
```

The import namespace remains:

```python
from fastmcp import Client
```

Install optional extras/packages only for feature families actually used. The most important v4 packaging change is **background tasks**: the modern task implementation lives in optional **`fastmcp-tasks`** and is exposed through a negotiated extension. A server declaring `task=True` without the Tasks extension fails startup rather than advertising a capability it cannot execute.

```bash
uv add "fastmcp==4.0.0" fastmcp-tasks
```

Register the task extension as documented in §12/§39. Do not treat the old v3 bundled Docket integration as the v4 package model.

## 1.2 Python project declaration

```toml
[project]
name = "inventory-mcp"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
  "fastmcp==4.0.0",
  "pydantic>=2.12,<3",
]

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
  "pytest>=8",
  "pytest-asyncio>=0.24",
  "inline-snapshot>=0.20",
  "ruff>=0.12",
  "mypy>=1.16",
]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
```

If FastMCP is mounted under FastAPI/Starlette, make the compatible web-stack floor explicit in the project/lockfile.

## 1.3 Lockfiles and upgrade discipline

```bash
uv lock
uv sync --frozen
```

A lockfile does not replace an explicit framework target. Record the validated FastMCP version in project metadata and CI diagnostics. FastMCP sits on authentication, HTTP, schema, and protocol boundaries, so patch releases can have meaningful security/interoperability impact.

## 1.4 Version and package verification

```bash
fastmcp version
python -c 'import fastmcp; print(fastmcp.__version__)'
```

In v4, MCP Python model attributes are **snake_case** while serialized wire fields remain protocol-compatible camelCase. New code should use Python attributes such as `input_schema`, `output_schema`, `structured_content`, `is_error`, `mime_type`, and `next_cursor`.

## 1.5 Protocol types vs FastMCP-specific types

MCP protocol models belong to the MCP SDK/protocol-model surface (with SDK re-exports such as `mcp.types`). `fastmcp.types` is for FastMCP-specific types. Do not mechanically move every old MCP type import into `fastmcp.types`; use the current SDK location.

## 1.6 `httpx2` migration

FastMCP 4 uses `httpx2` internally. This matters when passing HTTP clients into FastMCP rather than allowing the framework to construct them, including OpenAPI providers, custom client factories, proxy/auth hooks, and concrete-type test fixtures. Selected paths may temporarily accept legacy clients with deprecation warnings, but new integrations should target `httpx2`.

## 1.7 `fastmcp-remote`

`fastmcp-remote` remains the dedicated bridge for a **stdio-only host consuming a remote HTTP MCP server**:

```bash
uvx fastmcp-remote https://example.com/mcp
```

Keep roles distinct:

```text
fastmcp run       -> serve a FastMCP server you own
fastmcp-remote    -> bridge remote HTTP MCP into local STDIO
Client(...)       -> consume MCP programmatically
create_proxy(...) -> republish another MCP surface
```

## 1.8 Local script client sources use `Path`

FastMCP 4 deprecates ambiguous `Client("server.py")`. Use a `Path` for local scripts:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client(Path("server.py"))
```

The v4 additions worth making explicit are completion, extension, session, and modern multi-round/request-state behavior.

## 1.10 STDIO environment isolation

Desktop/IDE hosts may launch servers with a different interpreter, CWD, PATH, and environment than your shell. Make all of those explicit. Do not depend on shell aliases or an implicitly active virtualenv.

## 1.11 Smoke test

```python
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("smoke")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

# Use Client(mcp) in tests to verify the published contract.
```

## 1.12 v4 installation invariants

```text
[ ] Target FastMCP 4 explicitly; it is GA, not prerelease.
[ ] Keep fastmcp and fastmcp-slim versions coherent.
[ ] Confirm Pydantic >=2.12.
[ ] Audit Starlette/FastAPI compatibility for ASGI use.
[ ] Use httpx2 at FastMCP HTTP-client integration points.
[ ] Install/register fastmcp-tasks for task-enabled tools.
[ ] Use Path(...) for local Client script sources.
[ ] Keep MCP protocol types distinct from FastMCP-specific types.
[ ] Commit a lockfile and test the published MCP surface.
```

# FastMCP Advanced — 2) First executable server, client, and test


**FastMCP 4 status.** Minimal server syntax remains familiar. For local scripts, prefer `Client(Path("server.py"))`; bare script strings are deprecated because strings are converging on URL semantics. Default clients negotiate `mode="auto"`.

## 2.0 Objective

The first executable should prove the complete FastMCP path, not only decorator syntax:

```text
Python declaration
  -> FastMCP component registry
  -> MCP schema
  -> transport or in-memory session
  -> Client initialization
  -> list/call/read/get operations
  -> typed result
```

The canonical minimal FastMCP server remains intentionally small: construct `FastMCP`, decorate a function, and call `mcp.run()` under a `__main__` guard. The important implementation lesson is that **constructing/decorating defines the server; `run()` binds it to a transport**. ([Quickstart][1]) ([Running][2])

---

## 2.1 Minimal STDIO server

`server.py`:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Calculator",
    instructions="Use the arithmetic tools for deterministic calculations.",
    version="1.0.0",
)


@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers."""
    return a + b


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # STDIO by default
```

Run it directly:

```bash
python server.py
```

The process now speaks MCP on stdin/stdout; it is not a normal interactive CLI. A desktop/agent host normally owns the subprocess and protocol stream. ([Running][2])

### Critical STDIO rule

Do not print arbitrary text to stdout from server startup code. STDOUT is the protocol channel. Use Python logging to stderr or MCP context logging from within requests.

---

## 2.2 Minimal Streamable HTTP server

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Calculator")


@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(
        transport="http",
        host="127.0.0.1",
        port=8000,
    )
```

The default FastMCP HTTP endpoint is typically `/mcp`; connect a client to the full MCP endpoint, not merely the host root. Streamable HTTP is the normal network deployment choice; SSE is retained for legacy clients. ([Running][2])

```python
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client("http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp") as client:
    print(await client.ping())
```

---

## 2.3 Minimal in-memory client — preferred first test

You do **not** need a subprocess or network socket to test a FastMCP server.

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Calculator")


@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b


async def main() -> None:
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print([tool.name for tool in tools])

        result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 2, "b": 3})
        print(result.data)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

`Client(mcp)` uses an in-process transport while still exercising the MCP client/server boundary. This is the fastest deterministic validation path and the preferred foundation for unit/integration tests. ([Testing][3])

---

## 2.4 First server with all three core component types

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("ReferenceServer")


@mcp.tool
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Multiply two numbers."""
    return a * b


@mcp.resource("config://app")
def app_config() -> str:
    """Current application configuration."""
    return '{"mode":"demo"}'


@mcp.prompt
def review(topic: str) -> str:
    """Create a review request for a topic."""
    return f"Review {topic} for correctness, risk, and missing assumptions."


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Client verification:

```python
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client(mcp) as client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    prompts = await client.list_prompts()

    tool_result = await client.call_tool("multiply", {"a": 4.0, "b": 5.0})
    resource_result = await client.read_resource("config://app")
    prompt_result = await client.get_prompt("review", {"topic": "release plan"})
```

This is a better smoke test than importing the functions directly because it validates the published MCP surface rather than only local Python behavior.

---

## 2.5 First async tool

```python
import httpx
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("HTTP")


@mcp.tool(timeout=10.0)
async def fetch_status(url: str) -> int:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=5.0) as client:
        response = await client.get(url)
        return response.status_code
```

Use `async def` for naturally async I/O. FastMCP can run ordinary synchronous tools in a threadpool, but an async-native library should normally stay async to avoid unnecessary thread dispatch. ([Tools][4])

---

## 2.6 First typed tool with Pydantic metadata

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import Field

mcp = FastMCP("Typed")


@mcp.tool
def search(
    query: Annotated[
        str,
        Field(min_length=1, max_length=200, description="Search phrase"),
    ],
    limit: Annotated[
        int,
        Field(ge=1, le=100, description="Maximum number of results"),
    ] = 20,
    mode: Literal["exact", "fuzzy"] = "fuzzy",
) -> dict:
    return {"query": query, "limit": limit, "mode": mode, "items": []}
```

Before writing custom schema JSON, inspect what FastMCP already generates from the function signature.

---

## 2.7 First hidden runtime dependency

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.dependencies import Depends

mcp = FastMCP("DI")


def current_tenant() -> str:
    return "tenant-a"


@mcp.tool
async def list_orders(
    status: str,
    tenant: str = Depends(current_tenant),
) -> list[dict]:
    # `tenant` is runtime-only and does not appear in the tool schema.
    return []
```

This demonstrates the key schema boundary: **client parameters are explicit typed arguments; runtime infrastructure is injected**. ([DI][5])

---

## 2.8 First Context-aware tool

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.dependencies import CurrentContext
from fastmcp.server.context import Context

mcp = FastMCP("Context")


@mcp.tool
async def process(
    item_id: str,
    ctx: Context = CurrentContext(),
) -> dict:
    await ctx.info(f"Processing {item_id}")
    await ctx.report_progress(0.5, 1.0, "Halfway")
    return {"item_id": item_id, "ok": True}
```

Do not pass `Context` through domain layers that do not need MCP capabilities; use it at the adapter edge. ([Context][6])

---

## 2.9 First lifespan-managed dependency

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.lifespan import lifespan


@lifespan
async def server_lifespan(server):
    client = await create_expensive_client()
    try:
        yield {"client": client}
    finally:
        await client.aclose()


mcp = FastMCP("Lifecycle", lifespan=server_lifespan)
```

Tool:

```python
from fastmcp import Context


@mcp.tool
async def query_backend(q: str, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    client = ctx.lifespan_context["client"]
    return await client.query(q)
```

Use lifespan for pools, shared clients, caches, models, and other server-instance resources that should not be re-created per tool call. ([Lifespan][7])

---

## 2.10 First HTTP app export

For production ASGI hosting:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Analytics")


@mcp.tool
def health_value() -> int:
    return 1


app = mcp.http_app(path="/mcp")
```

Run with an ASGI server:

```bash
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

When mounting `mcp_app` inside a parent FastAPI/Starlette app, the FastMCP lifespan must be forwarded or combined. This is a correctness requirement for the session manager and other lifecycle state. ([HTTP][8])

---

## 2.11 First FastAPI mount

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Analytics")


@mcp.tool
def summarize(values: list[float]) -> dict:
    return {"count": len(values), "sum": sum(values)}


mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path="/mcp")
app = FastAPI(lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan)
app.mount("/analytics", mcp_app)
```

Externally reachable MCP path:

```text
/analytics/mcp
```

Do not accidentally combine a mount prefix and internal MCP path twice. ([FastAPI Integration][9])

---

## 2.12 First pytest fixture

`tests/conftest.py`:

```python
import pytest
from fastmcp import Client

from my_server.server import mcp


@pytest.fixture
async def client():
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        yield client
```

`tests/test_tools.py`:

```python
async def test_add(client):
    result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 2, "b": 5})
    assert result.data == 7


async def test_tool_catalog(client):
    names = {tool.name for tool in await client.list_tools()}
    assert "add" in names
```

This catches schema/registration/transport behavior that a direct `add(2, 5)` unit test cannot. ([Testing][3])

---

## 2.13 First contract snapshot

```python
from inline_snapshot import snapshot


async def test_tool_schema(client):
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    add = next(t for t in tools if t.name == "add")

    assert add.input_schema == snapshot(
        {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "a": {"type": "integer"},
                "b": {"type": "integer"},
            },
            "required": ["a", "b"],
        }
    )
```

Exact protocol objects may contain more metadata depending on version/config. Snapshot only fields that represent the contract you actually intend to freeze.

---

## 2.14 First `fastmcp.json`

A portable project can use a FastMCP configuration file instead of embedding every run option in shell commands.

Representative shape:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/latest.json",
  "source": "src/my_server/server.py:mcp"
}
```

Then run through FastMCP CLI:

```bash
fastmcp run fastmcp.json
```

Use the exact current schema documented for your stable version; treat the example as the minimal conceptual shape and see §27 for the complete configuration contract. ([Configuration][10])

---

## 2.15 First CLI inspection loop

Recommended development loop:

```bash
# show installed versions
fastmcp version

# inspect local server object
fastmcp inspect src/my_server/server.py:mcp

# run it
fastmcp run src/my_server/server.py:mcp

# from another shell, inspect a remote endpoint
fastmcp list http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

Depending on the local FastMCP CLI version, the exact command surface may include additional `dev`, Inspector, discovery, or host-install flows. Use `fastmcp --help` and §28 rather than guessing flags.

---

## 2.16 Synchronous vs asynchronous application boundaries

`FastMCP.run()` is synchronous and owns its event loop. Do not call it from inside an already-running async function.

Correct synchronous launcher:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http")
```

Correct async launcher:

```python
import asyncio


async def main():
    await mcp.run_async(transport="http")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

For web frameworks, prefer `http_app()` so the outer ASGI runtime owns process/event-loop lifecycle. ([Running][2])

---

## 2.17 What direct Python calls do not test

Calling a decorated function directly is useful for domain correctness:

```python
assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

But it does **not** prove:

* the component is registered;
* its public name is what you expect;
* its JSON Schema is correct;
* hidden dependencies are omitted;
* middleware runs;
* authorization is enforced;
* return conversion is correct;
* version/visibility selection is correct;
* the transport/handshake works.

Use both ordinary unit tests and MCP-boundary tests.

---

## 2.18 First production-shaped separation

`domain.py`:

```python
class OrderService:
    async def get_order(self, order_id: str, tenant_id: str) -> dict:
        ...
```

`dependencies.py`:

```python
from fastmcp.dependencies import Depends


async def get_order_service() -> OrderService:
    ...
```

`tools/orders.py`:

```python
from fastmcp.dependencies import Depends


@mcp.tool
async def get_order(
    order_id: str,
    service: OrderService = Depends(get_order_service),
) -> dict:
    return await service.get_order(order_id, tenant_id="...")
```

The key architecture is the separation: the MCP function is a thin adapter over a separately testable service, while runtime infrastructure is injected rather than exposed as model-visible arguments.

---

## 2.19 Failure-mode checklist for the first deployment

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Host reports server immediately exited | import error, wrong interpreter, missing dependency, or startup exception |
| Host “connects” but no tools | wrong server object/source, visibility transform, proxy upstream issue, or registration code not imported |
| HTTP client gets 404 | connected to host root instead of MCP path, or mount/path composition wrong |
| Tool input rejected | schema/type mismatch, strict validation, incorrect JSON shape |
| Tool works direct but fails over MCP | hidden dependency/context/result-conversion/auth issue |
| Mounted HTTP server hangs/fails sessions | FastMCP lifespan not propagated |
| STDIO protocol corruption | application printed arbitrary text to stdout |
| Remote bridge initializes empty | stale proxy behavior or wrong backend; 3.4 bridge should fail loudly on initialization errors |
| `Client(...)` call before context entry fails | session not initialized / lifecycle not entered |

---

## 2.20 First-app agent invariants

1. `FastMCP(...)` defines; `run*()` serves.
2. `@mcp.tool`/resource/prompt registration occurs at import/declaration time.
3. `Client` operations are async and normally live inside `async with`.
4. In-memory `Client(mcp)` is the default test transport.
5. Streamable HTTP is the default new network transport; SSE is legacy.
6. Keep `mcp.run()` under `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
7. Keep stdout clean for STDIO.
8. Use `http_app()` when another ASGI framework owns serving.
9. Forward/combine FastMCP lifespan when mounting.
10. Test the published MCP surface, not only the underlying Python functions.

---

## 2.21 Anti-pattern inventory

* `mcp.run()` at module import time.
* calling `mcp.run()` inside an async FastAPI startup hook.
* testing only direct Python function calls.
* using a real TCP port for every unit test when in-memory Client works.
* putting runtime-only DB handles into public tool parameters.
* printing banners/debug text to stdout under STDIO.
* connecting `Client("http://host:8000")` when the endpoint is `/mcp`.
* mounting `/mcp` and also using internal `path="/mcp"` without checking final path.
* creating a new expensive HTTP/DB client on every tool call instead of lifespan/DI.
* using `collect everything into one server.py` as the project grows.

---

## 2.22 First executable checklist

```text
[ ] Server object imports successfully.
[ ] mcp.run() is protected by __main__.
[ ] STDIO startup emits no arbitrary stdout.
[ ] In-memory Client can initialize.
[ ] list_tools/resources/prompts matches expected contract.
[ ] At least one tool is invoked through Client.
[ ] Typed validation failure is tested.
[ ] Lifespan startup/cleanup is tested if shared state exists.
[ ] HTTP endpoint path is verified if using network transport.
[ ] Mounted ASGI lifespan is forwarded.
[ ] Production code separates domain logic from MCP adapters.

# FastMCP Advanced — 3) Core API map and object model

## 3.0 FastMCP 4 ownership map

FastMCP 4 retains the provider/transform architecture and adds first-class extension, modern interaction, session, completion, and client-group surfaces.

* **`FastMCP`** — root server definition/resolved execution surface: identity, local registration, providers, transforms, middleware, extensions, auth, completion handling, lifespan, session storage, and serving APIs.
* **`LocalProvider`** — storage for directly registered tools/resources/prompts/templates.
* **`Provider`** — source boundary for dynamic/composable components.
* **`Transform`** — publication-time rewrite/filter layer.
* **`ServerExtension`** — negotiated capability that can add request methods, intercept tool calls, and own lifespan behavior.
* **`Client`** — one connection/protocol-era consumer.
* **`ClientGroup`** — client-side aggregation/routing across independent servers.
* **`FastMCPApp`** — Provider specialized for MCP Apps UI topology.
* **`UserSession` / `SessionId`** — explicit modern cross-request state abstractions.

The key separation is: **providers source; transforms publish/reshape; middleware governs live messages; extensions add negotiated protocol behavior**.

## 3.1 `FastMCP`

Direct decorator registrations populate `local_provider`; additional providers are aggregated behind it; server transforms operate on the aggregate view; final listing/execution passes through visibility, auth, middleware, and version resolution.

Key v4 server families:

```text
registration: tool/resource/prompt + completion
composition: add_provider / mount / create_proxy / add_transform
policy: add_middleware / add_extension / auth
state: lifespan / session_state_store / request_state_security
execution: call_tool / read_resource / render_prompt
```

Old `FastMCP.as_proxy(...)` and `import_server(...)` are not modern v4 composition APIs; use `create_proxy(...)` and `mount(...)`.

## 3.2 Provider

Providers answer where components come from: local code, mounted servers, proxies, filesystem/skills, OpenAPI, or custom dynamic catalogs. Provider transforms run before root transforms. Use `wrap_transform()` for reusable providers to avoid cross-aggregator mutation.

## 3.3 Transform

Transforms modify the public component graph without rewriting domain implementation: namespace, tool/schema transformation, visibility, search/Code Mode, resources-as-tools, prompts-as-tools. Transform order is public API behavior.

## 3.4 Middleware

Middleware is the live policy layer. In v4 it sees a broader inbound message surface, including initialization/cancellation/progress-related traffic and some pre-handler failures. Use it for cross-cutting auth, quotas, logging, timing, caching, normalization, and request/response policy.

## 3.5 Server extensions

A `ServerExtension` may advertise capability/settings, add additive request methods through `MethodBinding`, intercept tool calls after middleware and before the tool body, and participate in lifespan. Register extensions on the **served/root server** before startup; mounted child extensions do not automatically become root-negotiated capabilities.

## 3.6 Client and protocol-era negotiation

A v4 `Client` owns one connection and negotiated era. `mode="auto"` is the normal compatibility posture. One FastMCP 4 server can simultaneously accept modern and legacy clients; era is negotiated per connection, not selected process-wide.

## 3.7 ClientGroup

`ClientGroup` aggregates independent clients while each keeps its own transport/auth/handlers/extensions/protocol mode. Use it when a Python application needs several MCP servers but does not need to republish a gateway endpoint. Use a FastMCP proxy/gateway when republishing is the actual requirement.

## 3.8 Sessions vs request state

FastMCP 4 separates:

* **request state** — sealed continuation state for one modern interactive request across reruns;
* **cross-request session state** — `UserSession` or `SessionId` backed by configured storage.

Modern requests are otherwise self-contained. Old transport-session continuity should not be assumed.

## 3.9 Apps remain provider-based

`FastMCPApp` remains a Provider abstraction, not a separate transport. UI entry tools and UI-only backend tools compose through provider topology and special app-backend resolution.

## 3.10 Decision table

| Need | Reach for |
|---|---|
| local capability | `@mcp.tool/resource/prompt` |
| dynamic source | `Provider` |
| reshape catalog | `Transform` |
| cross-cutting live policy | Middleware |
| negotiated protocol feature | `ServerExtension` |
| child server | `mount()` |
| republish remote server | `create_proxy()` / `ProxyProvider` |
| one server consumer | `Client` |
| many independent consumers | `ClientGroup` |
| authenticated-user state | `UserSession` |
| explicit session handle | `SessionId` + session provider |
| modern multi-round input | guard + `InputRequiredResult` |

# FastMCP Advanced — 4) Server construction and lifecycle

## 4.0 v4 constructor mental model

FastMCP 4 keeps server definition separate from transport serving. Construct `FastMCP(...)` with identity, composition, policy, storage, and lifecycle concerns; bind STDIO/HTTP later through `run*()` or `http_app()`.

Important v4 changes:

* server-side `sampling_handler` / `sampling_handler_behavior` are removed;
* modern cross-request state uses explicit session APIs rather than implicit transport-session assumptions;
* modern multi-round interaction introduces request-state security;
* extensions are registered through `add_extension()` before serving;
* completion is first-class through `@mcp.completion` / `add_completion_handler()`.

Use the current SDK reference as the exact signature source.

## 4.1 Identity

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Inventory",
    version="2.0.0",
    instructions="Use search before broad listings.",
)
```

Set application identity/version explicitly for production rather than letting a library upgrade become your product version.

## 4.2 Composition

```python
mcp = FastMCP(
    "Gateway",
    providers=[provider_a, provider_b],
    transforms=[global_transform],
    middleware=[policy_middleware],
    lifespan=app_lifespan,
    auth=auth_provider,
)
```

Direct components remain in `local_provider`; added providers remain distinct sources. Resolve collisions with namespaces/transforms rather than relying on incidental registration order.

## 4.3 Server-side sampling configuration is removed

Do not carry forward v3 configuration such as:

```python
# obsolete in v4
# FastMCP(..., sampling_handler=..., sampling_handler_behavior=...)
```

Modern requests do not support the old server-calls-back-into-client sampling/roots model. If server code needs an LLM, call a model provider directly as application code or redesign the workflow around explicit modern interaction. Client-side sampling handlers remain relevant only to protocol flows that actually support those callbacks.

## 4.4 Lifespan

```python
from fastmcp.server.lifespan import lifespan

@lifespan
async def app_lifespan(server):
    db = await open_database_pool()
    try:
        yield {"db": db}
    finally:
        await db.close()
```

Use lifespan for shared process/server-instance resources, not request-local mutable state. Forward/combine the FastMCP lifespan when mounting into a parent ASGI application.

## 4.5 Session storage

`session_state_store` backs explicit FastMCP session abstractions. In v4 classify state deliberately:

```text
lifespan          -> server-instance resources
request state     -> one multi-round modern operation
UserSession       -> authenticated-user cross-request state
SessionId         -> explicit app/session-handle state
domain database   -> durable business state
```

Use shared storage when requests can land on different replicas and the session must persist across them.

## 4.6 Request-state security

Guard-based modern interaction may return sealed state that comes back on the next request round. Multi-replica deployments must share compatible request-state security keys so any replica can verify/resume the flow. Use strong secret key material and support key rotation with an appropriate key ring where required.

## 4.7 Middleware

Middleware remains ordered and bidirectional. In v4 it observes a broader inbound message surface than many v3 implementations assumed. Use it for cross-cutting errors, auth policy, rate limits, safe caching, logging/tracing/timing, and request/response limits.

## 4.8 Extensions

```python
mcp.add_extension(my_extension)
```

Register before serving. Extensions can advertise negotiated capability/settings, add non-core request methods, intercept tool calls, and own optional lifespan. They cannot shadow core MCP methods. Root-server registration matters for negotiation.

## 4.9 Completion handler

```python
@mcp.completion
async def complete(ref, argument, context):
    ...
```

One handler can serve prompt and resource-template references. Keep it fast and side-effect-free. Completion is connection-authenticated but not automatically equivalent to per-component visibility/authorization, so enforce policy manually for sensitive candidate sets.

## 4.10 Serving

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # STDIO
```

or:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

Use `run_async()` when the caller owns an async loop, and `http_app()` when an outer ASGI server/framework owns serving.

## 4.11 Protocol era is negotiated per connection

One v4 deployment can serve modern and legacy clients. Modern connections use self-contained requests, guard-driven multi-round interaction, and the modern task extension. Legacy connections may retain compatibility behavior for older callback/session flows. Prefer era-neutral business logic unless a feature genuinely depends on the era.

## 4.12 HTTP mounting/custom routes

Custom HTTP routes are suitable for health/status/light callback surfaces. For a full web app, mount FastMCP into Starlette/FastAPI. Compute the final MCP URL from mount prefix plus internal path, and preserve root-level OAuth discovery/base-URL rules.

# FastMCP Advanced — 5) Tools: definition, registration, and execution contract
### Tools: definition, registration, and execution contract

**FastMCP 4 status.** Tool declaration remains central. `task=` is now tool-only; modern interactive tools can return `InputRequiredResult`; tasks require the tasks extension to be registered.


### 5.0 Role and runtime contract

Tools are the executable MCP surface: a Python callable becomes a client-callable capability with an input schema, validation behavior, execution path, and result-conversion pipeline. The official tool docs define the runtime sequence as: client/LLM sends arguments using the tool schema, FastMCP validates against the function signature, the function executes, and the result is returned to the client. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

For agent authors, the compact model is: **Python function → tool registration metadata → generated input schema → validated invocation → sync/async execution → result conversion to MCP `content` and optional `structuredContent` → error/timeout/version handling**. Return annotations and tool configuration materially affect the last two stages, so “tool definition” is not just naming; it is the full wire contract. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

### 5.1 Registration surfaces

FastMCP exposes three practical registration paths for tools:

1. `@mcp.tool` for direct declaration and immediate registration on a server.
2. `mcp.add_tool(...)` for programmatic registration of a `Tool` instance or callable.
3. standalone `@tool()` for attaching tool metadata to methods or reusable functions before later registration with `mcp.add_tool(...)`. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-server), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-tools-function_tool))

The current server SDK documents `add_tool(self, tool: Tool | Callable[..., Any]) -> Tool`, and the local-provider SDK says the provider-side `add_tool` accepts either a `Tool` object or a decorated function with FastMCP metadata. That means `add_tool(...)` is not limited to raw functions; it is the polymorphic registration entrypoint that normalizes both already-built tools and metadata-decorated callables into server-owned tool objects. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-server), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-providers-local_provider-decorators-tools))

### 5.2 `@mcp.tool` — direct registration

The documented minimal form is the bare decorator:

```python id="o8gv9p"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Calculator")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two integers."""
    return a + b
```

In that minimal form, FastMCP auto-infers the MCP tool name from the Python function name, the tool description from the docstring, and the input schema from the function signature plus type annotations. It also handles parameter validation and error reporting automatically. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

The server SDK documents these supported calling patterns for `mcp.tool(...)`: `@server.tool`, `@server.tool()`, `@server.tool("custom_name")`, `@server.tool(name="custom_name")`, and `server.tool(function, name="custom_name")`. This matters for code generation because `@mcp.tool` is both a decorator and a registration function. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-server))

Representative forms:

```python id="iwnv1e"
@mcp.tool
def echo(text: str) -> str:
    return text

@mcp.tool()
def ping() -> str:
    return "pong"

@mcp.tool("search_catalog")
def search_impl(query: str) -> list[dict]:
    return []

@mcp.tool(name="search_catalog")
def search_impl2(query: str) -> list[dict]:
    return []

def external_fn(x: int) -> int:
    return x * 2

mcp.tool(external_fn, name="double")
```

Those are all first-class supported registration forms in the SDK surface. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-server))

### 5.3 `mcp.add_tool(...)` — programmatic registration

`mcp.add_tool(...)` is the lower-level registration primitive. The server SDK describes it as accepting a `Tool` instance or an `@tool`-decorated function and returning the registered `Tool`. It is the correct API when components are assembled dynamically, when you are registering bound methods, or when metadata is attached out-of-band via the standalone decorator. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-server))

```python id="8u44yo"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Programmatic")

def ping() -> str:
    return "pong"

mcp.add_tool(ping)
```

Internally, the source-level coercion rule is: if the argument is already a `Tool`, keep it; otherwise inspect the callable for attached FastMCP `ToolMeta`; if metadata is present, build the runtime tool with `FunctionTool.from_function(tool, metadata=fmeta)`; if not, fall back to `Tool.from_function(tool)`. That is the exact mechanism that makes standalone-decorated methods and reusable functions work correctly with `mcp.add_tool(...)`. ([github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

### 5.4 Standalone `@tool()` — metadata attachment without immediate registration

The standalone decorator lives in `fastmcp.tools.function_tool`. Its SDK page defines it as a decorator that marks a function as an MCP tool, **returns the original function with metadata attached**, and is intended to be registered later with `mcp.add_tool()`. This is the correct primitive for methods and reusable callables that should remain ordinary Python functions until bound or composed. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-tools-function_tool))

```python id="nq77gv"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import tool

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, multiplier: int):
        self.multiplier = multiplier

    @tool()
    def multiply(self, x: int) -> int:
        """Multiply by the instance multiplier."""
        return x * self.multiplier

calc = Calculator(multiplier=3)
mcp = FastMCP("Calc")
mcp.add_tool(calc.multiply)
```

The tools guide is explicit about why this exists: `@mcp.tool` registers immediately, which is wrong for instance/class methods because the unbound signature would expose `self` or `cls` as required tool parameters. With `@tool()` plus later registration of the **bound** method, FastMCP sees the correct signature and registers only the user-supplied arguments. The guide’s example states this directly for `mcp.add_tool(calc.multiply)`, which registers only `x`, not `self`. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

There is one additional v3 nuance that matters for agent-authored code: decorators now return the original function by default rather than a component object. The upgrade guide and settings docs both say `FASTMCP_DECORATOR_MODE=function` is the default; `object` compatibility mode exists but is deprecated. That default applies to `@mcp.tool` as well, which is why decorated functions remain directly callable in tests and non-MCP code paths. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-fastmcp-2), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/more/settings))

### 5.5 Supported callable forms: sync and async

FastMCP supports both synchronous `def` and asynchronous `async def` tool functions. The tools guide states that sync tools automatically run in a threadpool so they do not block the event loop, while async tools are still preferred for I/O-bound work because they are more efficient than threadpool dispatch. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

```python id="pux5ey"
import time
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Concurrency")

@mcp.tool
def slow_sync(x: int) -> int:
    time.sleep(2)
    return x * 2

@mcp.tool
async def fast_async(x: int) -> int:
    return x * 3
```

The operational guidance is therefore precise: use `async def` for network/database/file-async libraries and long-lived concurrent I/O; use `def` for simple CPU-light logic or when integrating synchronous libraries. FastMCP will still execute synchronous tools concurrently via threadpool dispatch. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

### 5.6 Exact decorator/configuration surface

At the docs layer, FastMCP prominently documents these `@mcp.tool(...)` arguments: `name`, `description`, `tags`, `enabled` (deprecated in v3), `icons`, `annotations`, `meta`, `timeout`, `version`, and `output_schema`. The docs further explain the semantics of each, including that `description` overrides the function docstring, `tags` support organization/filtering, `meta` is static tool-definition metadata, `timeout` is foreground execution timeout in seconds, `version` identifies tool versions, and `output_schema` declares structured output shape. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

The current source-level tool-construction surface is slightly broader. `Tool.from_function(...)` currently accepts `name`, `version`, `title`, `description`, `icons`, `tags`, `annotations`, `exclude_args`, `output_schema`, deprecated `serializer`, `meta`, `task`, `timeout`, and `auth`, then forwards that configuration into `FunctionTool.from_function(...)`. This is the authoritative current parameter set for the runtime tool factory. ([github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

For agent documentation, the most useful normalized view is:

* **identity**: `name`, `version`, optional source-level `title`
* **LLM/client description**: `description`, `annotations`
* **organization / exposure**: `tags`, `icons`, `meta`
* **execution policy**: `timeout`, `task`, `auth`
* **schema policy**: `output_schema`, deprecated `exclude_args`, deprecated `serializer` ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/authorization))

Representative dense form:

```python id="psca8f"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import require_scopes
from mcp.types import ToolAnnotations

mcp = FastMCP("Catalog")

@mcp.tool(
    name="find_products",
    description="Search catalog items by query and optional category filter.",
    tags={"catalog", "search"},
    meta={"team": "commerce", "stability": "ga"},
    timeout=15.0,
    version="2.1",
    output_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "items": {"type": "array"},
            "total": {"type": "integer"},
        },
        "required": ["items", "total"],
    },
    annotations=ToolAnnotations(
        title="Find Products",
        readOnlyHint=True,
        openWorldHint=False,
    ),
    auth=require_scopes("catalog:read"),
)
async def search_products(query: str, category: str | None = None) -> dict:
    return {"items": [], "total": 0}
```

That example is valid in the sense documented by the tools and authorization surfaces: component-level auth is supported, `timeout` and `version` are v3 tool features, annotations are advisory MCP metadata, and `output_schema` is explicit structured-output control. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/authorization))

### 5.7 Per-argument semantics

#### `name`

If omitted, FastMCP uses the Python function name as the exposed tool name. Tool names are later validated against MCP naming rules by the tool model validator in source. In practice, explicit `name=` should be used only when the Python implementation name is not the desired public contract. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

#### `description`

If omitted, FastMCP uses the function docstring. If provided, the explicit description wins and the function docstring is ignored for tool-description purposes. Best practice: keep implementation docstrings terse/internal, and use `description=` only when the model-facing description must diverge from internal developer documentation. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

#### `tags`

Tags are organizational metadata that the server and some clients can use for grouping/filtering. They also matter operationally because server-level visibility and auth patterns can target tags, so tags are not purely decorative. Prefer stable domain tags like `{"admin"}`, `{"read"}`, `{"billing"}`, `{"experimental"}` over ephemeral labels. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/visibility), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/authorization))

#### `meta`

The tools guide defines `meta` on the decorator as static metadata about the tool definition and distinguishes it from `ToolResult.meta`, which is runtime metadata about a specific execution. This distinction is crucial: definition metadata belongs on `@mcp.tool(meta=...)`; per-call metrics/debug info belong on `ToolResult(meta=...)`. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

#### `timeout`

`timeout` is a foreground execution timeout in seconds. If exceeded, the client receives an MCP error; the tools guide states the error code is `-32000` and that both sync and async tools support timeouts. There is no server-level default; timeouts must be opted into tool by tool. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

#### `version`

The tools guide says v3 tools support versioning and that clients automatically receive the highest version by default. The public tool/decorator surface and source both accept `version`, which means versioning is a first-class tool identity dimension, not a convention hidden inside `meta`. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

#### `output_schema`

`output_schema` is explicit JSON Schema control for structured output. If provided, the tool must return structured output matching it; if omitted, FastMCP tries to infer an output schema from the return annotation. The tools guide also states an important MCP constraint: output schemas must be object types. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

#### `annotations`

Annotations are advisory MCP metadata such as `title`, `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint`. They affect client UX and safety presentation rather than security enforcement. In current source, tool serialization prefers `self.title` if set, otherwise `annotations.title`; in practice, portable client-facing display titles are best expressed through annotations. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

#### `auth`

Component-level `auth` is supported in the current source-level tool factory and documented in the authorization guide through examples like `@mcp.tool(auth=require_scopes("admin"))`. Component-level auth both filters list visibility and enforces direct-access permissions for the current request. Authorization applies only in HTTP transports; STDIO bypasses OAuth/token-based auth checks. ([github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/authorization))

#### `task`

The tools guide documents `@mcp.tool(task=True)` for background execution. In current source, `task` is part of the tool-construction surface. This is not just a hint; it changes execution routing into Docket-backed task execution instead of normal foreground tool completion. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

#### Deprecated knobs

`enabled` is deprecated in v3 in favor of server-level `mcp.enable()` / `mcp.disable()`. `exclude_args` is deprecated in favor of dependency injection with `Depends()`. `serializer` still exists at the source/tool-model layer, but the docs explicitly recommend returning `ToolResult` for full serialization control instead. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-providers-local_provider-decorators-tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

### 5.8 What FastMCP auto-infers from the Python function

FastMCP auto-infers at least four major pieces of MCP contract data from the function itself: tool name from the Python symbol, description from the docstring, input schema from signature + type hints, and output schema from the return annotation when no explicit `output_schema` is supplied. Required vs optional parameters also follow normal Python default-value semantics, and parameter-level descriptions/constraints can be derived from `Annotated[...]`, plain string annotations, and `pydantic.Field(...)`. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

Parameter metadata inference is richer than “just types.” The tools guide documents `Annotated[str, "description"]` shorthand, `Field(description=..., ge=..., le=..., pattern=..., min_length=..., max_length=...)`, and default values as inputs to the generated schema. That means the correct authoring stance is: treat the Python signature as the primary schema source, and use Pydantic field metadata rather than out-of-band schema postprocessing whenever possible. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

Special parameter forms matter. A parameter annotated as `Context` is treated as MCP runtime context access, not an LLM-supplied argument; parameters using `Depends(...)` are automatically excluded from the tool schema and injected at runtime. This is the preferred mechanism for hidden runtime dependencies such as user IDs, credentials, DB handles, or request-scoped services. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-server), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

### 5.9 Why `*args` / `**kwargs` are unsupported

The tools guide is explicit: functions with `*args` or `**kwargs` are not supported as tools because FastMCP must generate a complete parameter schema for the MCP protocol, and a variadic signature cannot be expressed as a stable, fully specified MCP input schema. This is not an arbitrary framework restriction; it is a direct consequence of MCP’s need for precise machine-readable tool schemas. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

The practical design rule is: expose a fixed keyword-argument contract to the model. If your internal implementation wants variadic flexibility, hide that behind a stable wrapper function or a structured object parameter. For agent-authored code, that usually means “one explicit wrapper tool per user-facing action,” not “forward arbitrary kwargs into an internal SDK.” ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

### 5.10 Execution contract: validation, invocation, and result conversion

On invocation, FastMCP validates tool inputs against the generated schema/signature and then executes the function with validated values. Validation is flexible by default—stringified numerics and booleans may be coerced—unless the server enables `strict_input_validation=True`, in which case exact JSON Schema validation runs before the tool function is called. The tools guide recommends flexible validation for most real LLM-client use cases because many clients send stringified values. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

Return conversion has two layers: traditional MCP content blocks and optional structured output. The tools guide states that all results are converted to content blocks for backward compatibility, while object-like results such as dicts, dataclasses, and Pydantic models also become structured content automatically. Non-object results such as primitives and collections only become structured content when there is an output schema, typically derived from a return annotation or supplied explicitly. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

The current source gives the precise primitive-wrapping behavior: when `output_schema` exists for a primitive-like return, FastMCP may wrap the serialized value under `{"result": ...}` so the structured output remains an object-shaped JSON document, which matches the tools guide’s documented primitive wrapping rule. The same source also shows that `ToolResult` is a full passthrough escape hatch: if the raw return is already a `ToolResult`, FastMCP does not auto-wrap or reinterpret it. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

Automatic content conversion is type-sensitive. The tools guide documents these mappings: `str` to `TextContent`, `bytes` to embedded/base64 resource content, FastMCP `Image`/`Audio`/`File` helpers to corresponding MCP media/resource content, MCP content blocks passed through as-is, lists converted itemwise, and `None` producing an empty response. This means return-type design affects both model-visible text and machine-readable payloads. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

### 5.11 `ToolResult` — full-control response mode

When automatic conversion is insufficient, return `ToolResult`. The docs define it as the full-control response object with `content`, `structured_content`, and `meta`, and the current source enforces that at least one of `content` or `structured_content` must be provided. The docs further say `structured_content` must be a dictionary or `None`, and that if only `structured_content` is provided it is also used as the basis for generated content. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

```python id="sudr65"
from fastmcp.tools.tool import ToolResult
from mcp.types import TextContent

@mcp.tool
def advanced_tool() -> ToolResult:
    return ToolResult(
        content=[TextContent(type="text", text="Human-readable summary")],
        structured_content={"data": "value", "count": 42},
        meta={"execution_time_ms": 145},
    )
```

Use `ToolResult` when you need exact control over human-readable content, exact structured payload shape, or per-execution metadata. Use raw Python returns when the default conversion rules are acceptable and you want maximum brevity. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

### 5.12 Errors, timeouts, and background-task boundary

The tools guide says ordinary Python exceptions and FastMCP `ToolError` are both valid failure paths. By default, exceptions are logged and converted into MCP error responses; with `mask_error_details=True` at the server, generic exceptions are masked, but `ToolError` messages still propagate to clients. That makes `ToolError` the right mechanism for intentional, user-facing tool failures. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

Timeouts apply only to foreground execution. The tools guide is explicit that `timeout` does **not** apply when the tool runs as a background task via `task=True`; background timeouts must be enforced through Docket’s own timeout mechanisms. The guide also recommends task mode for known long-running jobs because FastMCP will otherwise treat a long foreground execution as a timeout-worthy failure. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

### 5.13 Best-practice authoring rules for agents

Prefer **explicit, fixed, keyword-shaped signatures** with rich type hints and `Field(...)` metadata. This yields better schema generation, better client interoperability, and fewer downstream transform hacks. Avoid variadics, implicit JSON-in-string arguments, and overly clever Python signatures that do not map cleanly to stable MCP input schemas. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools))

Use `@mcp.tool` for ordinary top-level functions; use standalone `@tool()` plus `mcp.add_tool(bound_method)` for instance/class methods or reusable function libraries. This is the only robust way to keep `self`/`cls` out of the published schema while preserving normal Python callability. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-tools-function_tool))

Prefer return annotations and ordinary object returns when automatic structured output is sufficient; use explicit `output_schema` only when the inferred schema is not the public contract you want. Prefer `ToolResult` over deprecated serializer-based customization when you need exact response control. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [github.com](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool.py))

Prefer `Depends(...)` for hidden runtime parameters and `Context` for MCP capabilities; do not expose infrastructure-only inputs as public tool arguments. The tool schema should represent what the client/LLM is actually expected to supply, not what the runtime needs internally. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-server))

Prefer server-level visibility control over deprecated per-tool `enabled=`. Prefer explicit `version=` when maintaining parallel implementations under one public tool name. Prefer `auth=` only on HTTP-facing servers where token-based authorization actually exists. ([gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools), [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/authorization))

The next logical deep dive is **5) Tools: typing, validation, hidden parameters, outputs, and content blocks**, because once the registration/execution surface is fixed, the next agent-critical layer is the schema engine itself: parameter typing, `Annotated`/`Field`, `Depends`, `Context`, output-schema generation, `ToolResult`, media/file return helpers, and exact result-shaping rules.

# FastMCP Advanced — 6) Tools: typing, validation, hidden parameters, outputs, and content blocks
### Tools: typing, validation, hidden parameters, outputs, and content blocks

**FastMCP 4 status.** Prefer snake_case protocol fields (`input_schema`, `output_schema`, `structured_content`, `is_error`). FastMCP temporarily bridges common camelCase reads with deprecation warnings, but new code should use snake_case.


### Version anchors used here

The relevant feature gates for this section are spread across several releases: output schemas and structured content in `2.10.0`, `Annotated[str, "description"]` shorthand in `2.11.0`, flexible-vs-strict input validation in `2.13.0`, `ToolResult.meta` in `2.13.1`, `Depends()`-based hidden parameters in `2.14.0`, `CurrentContext()` as the preferred explicit context dependency in `2.14`, and per-tool `timeout=` plus `version=` in `3.0.0`. The docs also note that serve-time schema dereferencing is on by default unless the server disables it with `dereference_schemas=False`. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.0 Contract summary: what the tool signature controls

A FastMCP tool signature is the primary schema source. FastMCP inspects the function name, docstring, parameter list, defaults, and type annotations to derive the MCP-visible name, description, required-vs-optional argument set, and input schema; on execution it validates arguments against that contract before calling the function. Functions using `*args` or `**kwargs` are rejected because FastMCP must emit a complete parameter schema for MCP, and variadic signatures do not map to a stable machine-readable contract. ([FastMCP][1])

The consequence for agent authors is strict: the public tool API should be modeled as a fixed, schema-friendly Python function, not as a thin wrapper over an internal variadic API. If the internal implementation wants dynamic argument handling, put that behind a stable, explicitly typed MCP-facing wrapper. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.1 Argument schema generation from type hints

FastMCP generates tool input schemas from the function signature and Python type annotations. The tools docs explicitly call out support for standard scalar types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`), binary `bytes`, date/time types, collections like `list[str]` and `dict[str, int]`, optionals and unions, constrained types such as `Literal[...]` and `Enum`, `Path`, `UUID`, and Pydantic models; the same section notes that FastMCP supports the full set of types that Pydantic supports as fields. ([FastMCP][1])

Representative authoring shape:

```python id="2fup92"
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Literal
from uuid import UUID
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("TypedTools")

@mcp.tool
def ingest_document(
    file: Path,
    tenant_id: UUID,
    mode: Literal["fast", "accurate"] = "fast",
    retries: int = 3,
) -> dict:
    return {"ok": True}
```

Requiredness follows ordinary Python rules: parameters without defaults are required; parameters with defaults are optional; `None`-typed optionals remain optional in the generated schema. ([FastMCP][1])

Two subtle but important type-behavior notes are documented. First, `bytes` parameters accept raw strings and are **not** automatically base64-decoded; if the client will send base64, use `str` and decode manually. Second, Pydantic-model parameters must be provided as JSON objects, not as stringified JSON, even in flexible validation mode. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.2 Serve-time schema shaping and `$ref` dereferencing

The tools docs state that FastMCP automatically dereferences `$ref` entries in tool schemas at serve time by default, specifically to improve compatibility with MCP clients that do not fully support JSON Schema references. Schemas are stored with `$ref` intact internally and flattened only when sent to clients; opting out is done at the server level with `FastMCP(..., dereference_schemas=False)`. ([FastMCP][1])

Operationally, that means the Python signature remains the canonical schema source, but the wire-level schema seen by clients may be a serve-time flattened variant. Agent-authored tests that compare server-emitted schemas should account for this distinction instead of assuming that internal Pydantic/OpenAPI-style `$defs` survive transport unchanged. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.3 Validation modes: flexible vs strict

Validation mode is server-level, not per-tool. The tools docs say the default is flexible Pydantic validation, which coerces compatible values to the annotated type—for example `"10"` to `int`, `"3.14"` to `float`, `"true"` to `bool`, and lists of string numerics to `list[int]`. Strict mode is enabled via `FastMCP(..., strict_input_validation=True)` and uses the MCP SDK’s JSON Schema validation to reject such mismatches before the function runs. ([FastMCP][1])

That yields a crisp decision rule. Use flexible mode for most real MCP deployments because LLM clients often stringify values. Use strict mode only when exact wire-type conformance matters more than client leniency—for example, compliance-sensitive systems or test harnesses validating a third-party client implementation. ([FastMCP][1])

Minimal strict-mode example:

```python id="hh8fht"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("StrictServer", strict_input_validation=True)

@mcp.tool
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

Under that policy, `{"a": "10", "b": "20"}` fails validation instead of being coerced. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.4 Parameter metadata: `Annotated[...]` shorthand and `Field(...)`

FastMCP supports two main metadata layers on parameters. For lightweight descriptions, the docs support `Annotated[T, "description"]`; this is equivalent to `Field(description=...)` but only when the `Annotated` metadata is a single string. For richer contracts, use `Annotated[T, Field(...)]`, which supports both documentation and validation constraints. The docs also note that `Field(...)` as a default value works, but the `Annotated[...]` form is preferred. ([FastMCP][1])

Shorthand description form:

```python id="h9pqn6"
from typing import Annotated
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Metadata")

@mcp.tool
def process_image(
    image_url: Annotated[str, "URL of the image to process"],
    resize: Annotated[bool, "Whether to resize the image"] = False,
    width: Annotated[int, "Target width in pixels"] = 800,
) -> dict:
    return {"ok": True}
```

Rich validation/documentation form:

```python id="y0m0uy"
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from pydantic import Field
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Metadata")

@mcp.tool
def process_image(
    image_url: Annotated[str, Field(description="URL of the image to process")],
    width: Annotated[int, Field(description="Target width in pixels", ge=1, le=2000)] = 800,
    format: Annotated[
        Literal["jpeg", "png", "webp"],
        Field(description="Output image format"),
    ] = "jpeg",
) -> dict:
    return {"ok": True}
```

The documented `Field(...)` features include `description`, `ge` / `gt` / `le` / `lt`, `min_length` / `max_length`, `pattern`, and `default`. For schema-oriented tool authoring, `Field(...)` is the highest-leverage way to encode argument contracts without hand-writing JSON schema. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.5 Hidden parameters and dependency injection

FastMCP’s rule for hidden runtime-only parameters is simple: if a parameter is recognized as a dependency, it is excluded from the MCP schema and injected at runtime. The dependency-injection docs state this globally, and the tools page explicitly recommends `Depends()` for runtime-only values like user IDs, credentials, and DB connections. ([FastMCP][2])

Canonical `Depends()` pattern:

```python id="4401oj"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.dependencies import Depends

mcp = FastMCP("HiddenDeps")

def get_user_id() -> str:
    return "user_123"

@mcp.tool
def get_user_details(user_id: str = Depends(get_user_id)) -> str:
    return f"Details for {user_id}"
```

Here `user_id` is injected by the server and does not appear in the MCP-exposed callable schema. That is the preferred modern replacement for the older `exclude_args` pattern. The public server SDK still exposes `exclude_args`, but marks it deprecated and directs users toward `Depends()` instead. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.6 Context as a hidden injected parameter

`Context` is also a dependency parameter and therefore hidden from the tool schema. The dependency-injection docs state that a parameter annotated as `Context` is injected automatically, and the context page says the preferred explicit form since `2.14` is `ctx: Context = CurrentContext()`. The context page also states that context methods are async, that each request gets a fresh context object, and that context is only valid during a request. ([FastMCP][2])

Preferred explicit form:

```python id="n5czz7"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.dependencies import CurrentContext
from fastmcp.server.context import Context

mcp = FastMCP("ContextDemo")

@mcp.tool
async def process_file(file_uri: str, ctx: Context = CurrentContext()) -> str:
    await ctx.info(f"Processing {file_uri}")
    return "Processed file"
```

Legacy type-hint-only injection still works:

```python id="xv9wtg"
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP("ContextDemo")

@mcp.tool
async def process_file(file_uri: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    return "Processed file"
```

The explicit `CurrentContext()` form is better for agent-generated code because the hidden dependency is visible in the signature, while still staying خارج the tool schema seen by clients. ([FastMCP][3])

### 6.7 Timeouts

Per-tool timeouts are configured with `@mcp.tool(timeout=<seconds>)`. The tools docs say this feature is new in `3.0.0`, that the timeout is expressed as a float in seconds, that both sync and async tools support it, and that expiration returns an MCP error with code `-32000`. The docs are also explicit that there is no server-level default timeout; tools must opt in individually. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="jlwm5h"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Timeouts")

@mcp.tool(timeout=30.0)
async def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    return {"url": url}
```

Timeouts only apply to foreground execution. The tools docs explicitly say `timeout` does **not** apply to background-task execution (`task=True`); for task time limits, use Docket’s own timeout mechanisms instead. That distinction is easy to miss and should be encoded directly into agent templates for long-running operations. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.8 Return model: content blocks + structured content + output schema

FastMCP’s return contract has three layers: the raw Python return value, the MCP `content` blocks shown to users/models, and optional machine-readable `structuredContent`. The tools docs say all tool results are always converted into traditional content blocks for backward compatibility, while structured output is emitted when the return value has an object representation or when an output schema is present. ([FastMCP][1])

The documented automatic structured-output rules are:

* object-like returns (`dict`, dataclasses, Pydantic models) always become structured content, even without an explicit output schema;
* non-object returns (`int`, `str`, `list`) only become structured content when an output schema exists, typically via a return annotation or explicit `output_schema`;
* all results still become traditional content blocks. ([FastMCP][1])

This distinction is the key authoring rule for tool returns. If you want machine-readable output by default, prefer object-shaped returns. Primitive-only returns are fine, but they need a return annotation or explicit output schema to participate in the structured-output channel. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.9 Automatic output-schema generation from return annotations

FastMCP automatically generates output schemas from return type annotations. The tools docs say this works for basic types, collections, unions, dataclasses, TypedDicts, and Pydantic models. For dataclasses and Pydantic models specifically, FastMCP extracts field definitions to produce detailed schemas; clients then receive both `content` and `structuredContent`. ([FastMCP][1])

Typed-model example:

```python id="s0w727"
from dataclasses import dataclass
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Profiles")

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    email: str

@mcp.tool
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> Person:
    return Person(name="Alice", age=30, email="alice@example.com")
```

For primitive returns, FastMCP wraps the value under a `"result"` key so the structured output remains a valid object-shaped JSON document, since output schemas must have an object root. The docs show this explicitly for return types like `-> int`. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="s6k1tf"
@mcp.tool
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

If you remove the return annotation entirely for a primitive-like result, the tool still produces `content`, but not structured output. That difference is explicitly documented and is a common source of confusion in downstream client integrations. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.10 Manual `output_schema={...}`

Manual schema override is done with `@mcp.tool(output_schema={...})`. The tools docs say that when `output_schema` is supplied, the tool must return structured output matching that schema; they also state the schema root must be an object, not a primitive or array root. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="6l12ud"
@mcp.tool(
    output_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "data": {"type": "string"},
            "metadata": {"type": "object"},
        },
        "required": ["data", "metadata"],
    }
)
def custom_schema_tool() -> dict:
    return {"data": "Hello", "metadata": {"version": "1.0"}}
```

Use explicit `output_schema` when the inferred return schema is not the public contract you want—for example, when a loose `dict[str, Any]` implementation should still expose a narrow client-facing schema, or when you want to freeze a tool contract even as internal model classes evolve. The docs also note that `ToolResult` can still supply structured output even without an explicit output schema, but validation/documentation are strongest when the schema is declared. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.11 `ToolResult` — full manual control

For full control over tool responses, return `ToolResult`. The tools docs define its public fields as `content`, `structured_content`, and `meta`; they also state that at least one of `content` or `structured_content` must be provided, that `structured_content` must be a dictionary or `None`, and that if only `structured_content` is provided it is also used as `content` after JSON-string conversion. The current source matches that contract and enforces the “at least one of the two” invariant in `ToolResult.__init__`. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="cg2r8m"
from fastmcp.tools.tool import ToolResult
from mcp.types import TextContent

@mcp.tool
def advanced_tool() -> ToolResult:
    return ToolResult(
        content=[TextContent(type="text", text="Human-readable summary")],
        structured_content={"data": "value", "count": 42},
        meta={"execution_time_ms": 145},
    )
```

`ToolResult.meta` is runtime metadata about a specific execution, not static definition metadata. The tools docs explicitly distinguish this from `@mcp.tool(meta={...})`, which describes the tool definition itself. The docs also say that when returning `ToolResult`, FastMCP does not automatically wrap or transform the payload, and that `ToolResult` can be used with or without an output schema. ([FastMCP][1])

For agent authors, the decision rule is simple. Use raw Python returns for default behavior and low ceremony. Use `ToolResult` when you need exact control over the `content`/`structuredContent` split, when you need execution metadata, or when you want to bypass the framework’s automatic wrapping rules. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.12 Content-block conversion rules

The tools docs define the automatic content-block mapping as follows: `str` becomes `TextContent`; `bytes` becomes base64-encoded embedded resource content; `Image` becomes `ImageContent`; `Audio` becomes `AudioContent`; `File` becomes an embedded resource; MCP SDK content blocks pass through unchanged; `None` yields an empty response. Lists of supported content/media items are also supported. ([FastMCP][1])

That conversion layer is independent of structured output. Even when a return value also generates `structuredContent`, FastMCP still emits content blocks for backward compatibility. This is why raw dict/model returns can satisfy both model-facing and machine-facing clients simultaneously. ([FastMCP][1])

### 6.13 `Image`, `Audio`, and `File` helper return types

FastMCP ships helper classes in `fastmcp.utilities.types` for binary/media returns. The tools docs say returning `Image`, `Audio`, or `File` directly—or as part of a list—causes automatic conversion into the appropriate MCP content block. The utilities SDK documents the corresponding manual-conversion helpers: `Image.to_image_content(...)`, `Audio.to_audio_content(...)`, and `File.to_resource_content(...)`. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="7wp5wy"
from fastmcp.utilities.types import Image, Audio, File

@mcp.tool
def get_chart() -> Image:
    return Image(path="chart.png")

@mcp.tool
def get_clip() -> Audio:
    return Audio(path="sample.wav")

@mcp.tool
def get_report() -> File:
    return File(path="report.pdf")
```

The tools docs also define the constructor contract for these helpers: use either `path=` or `data=` (mutually exclusive); `data=` requires `format=` so MIME type can be determined; `File` additionally supports `name=` when using `data=`; all helper types support optional content `annotations`. ([FastMCP][1])

One important caveat is also explicit in the docs: helper classes are only auto-converted when returned directly or as part of a list. They are **not** automatically converted when nested inside containers like dicts. For nested/object use, manually call `.to_image_content()`, `.to_audio_content()`, or `.to_resource_content()`. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="wzl9n5"
from fastmcp.utilities.types import Image

@mcp.tool
def nested_media() -> dict:
    return {
        "image": Image(path="chart.png").to_image_content()
    }
```

### 6.14 Authoring patterns that produce stable MCP contracts

Pattern 1: for machine-consumable tools, prefer object-shaped return types—dicts, dataclasses, Pydantic models, TypedDicts—because they automatically participate in structured output and generate richer schemas. Primitive-only returns are concise, but they need explicit return annotations or manual `output_schema` to become structured. ([FastMCP][1])

Pattern 2: use `Annotated[..., Field(...)]` as the default parameter-contract idiom. It keeps the Python signature readable while allowing descriptions, bounds, regexes, and default semantics to live in one place. Use `Annotated[..., "description"]` only for the lightweight case where you need prose but no constraints. ([FastMCP][1])

Pattern 3: hide runtime-only values with DI, not with public parameters. `Depends()`, `CurrentContext()`, and recognized injected dependency types keep the MCP schema aligned with what the LLM/client is actually expected to provide. The docs explicitly recommend this and deprecate `exclude_args` in favor of DI. ([FastMCP][2])

Pattern 4: reserve `ToolResult` for cases that truly need manual control. Overusing it removes some of the benefits of automatic schema/content generation; underusing it forces awkward hacks when you really need distinct human-facing text, structured data, and metadata in one response. ([FastMCP][1])

Pattern 5: put long-running foreground work behind `timeout=` and put truly long-running workflows behind `task=True`. The docs explicitly separate those two execution models and say foreground timeouts do not govern background tasks. ([FastMCP][1])

# FastMCP Advanced — 7) Resources and resource templates
### Resources and resource templates

**FastMCP 4 status.** Resource/template fundamentals remain. Template argument path-traversal screening is now enforced by default before handlers run. Background `task=` is no longer supported on resources/templates.


### 7.0 Resource model: what a resource is, and when it is the right abstraction

Resources are the MCP read-side surface: they expose **read-only** data or files addressable by URI, and when a client requests a resource URI FastMCP resolves the definition, executes the backing function if the resource is function-backed, and returns text, JSON-like content, or binary data. Resource templates extend the same model by letting one URI pattern represent a family of on-demand resources parameterized by URI values. Use a resource when the capability is fundamentally “retrieve data at a stable address,” not “perform an imperative action”; use a template when the address pattern is stable but the concrete instance is parameterized. ([FastMCP][1])

### 7.1 `@mcp.resource(...)` — primary declaration surface

The primary declaration form is `@mcp.resource(uri, ...)`. The decorator requires a resource URI and supports metadata fields including `name`, `description`, `mime_type`, `tags`, `icons`, `annotations`, `meta`, and `version`; `enabled` still appears in the docs but is deprecated in v3 in favor of server-level `mcp.enable()` / `mcp.disable()`. Name defaults to the Python function name, description defaults to the docstring, and `mime_type` is inferred when possible but should be set explicitly for nontrivial content types. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="y0jjxt"
import json
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

@mcp.resource(
    uri="data://app-status",
    name="ApplicationStatus",
    description="Provides the current status of the application.",
    mime_type="application/json",
    tags={"monitoring", "status"},
    meta={"version": "2.1", "team": "infrastructure"},
)
def get_application_status() -> str:
    return json.dumps({"status": "ok"})
```

At the SDK level, `FastMCP.resource(...)` is documented as a decorator that registers a function as a resource, accepts sync or async functions, returns text from `str`, binary from `bytes`, and otherwise treats the callable as a resource generator. It also explicitly allows a `Context` parameter and states that if the URI contains parameters or the function has parameters, the registration becomes a **template resource** rather than a simple static resource definition. ([FastMCP][2])

### 7.2 Static resources, function-backed resources, and templates: object-model split

FastMCP has three practically distinct resource forms. First, **function-backed fixed-URI resources**: a normal `@mcp.resource("scheme://fixed-uri")` function that runs only when the resource is read. Second, **concrete resource objects** such as `TextResource`, `FileResource`, and `DirectoryResource`, registered with `mcp.add_resource(...)`; these are the preferred form for predefined static content and direct file/URL-backed content. Third, **resource templates**, where the URI contains placeholders like `{id}` or `{path*}` and each unique parameter set generates a concrete resource on demand. The docs emphasize that `@mcp.resource` is ideal for dynamic content, while concrete `Resource` subclasses are the direct-registration path for predefined/static content. ([FastMCP][1])

The lazy-loading property is not incidental. The `FunctionResource` SDK page states that a function-backed resource defers data loading until the resource is actually read, which is particularly important because resource listing does not eagerly execute the function. That gives function-backed resources a strong value case when the content is expensive to compute but should still be discoverable by clients via `resources/list`. ([FastMCP][3])

### 7.3 `mcp.add_resource(...)` and direct registration

`FastMCP.add_resource(self, resource: Resource | Callable[..., Any]) -> Resource | ResourceTemplate` is the programmatic registration API. It accepts either a concrete `Resource` instance or an `@resource`-decorated function and returns the normalized registered object; if the callable represents a template, the return type is a `ResourceTemplate`, not a plain `Resource`. For direct template registration there is also `add_template(self, template: ResourceTemplate) -> ResourceTemplate`. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="a4qq5x"
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.resources import TextResource, FileResource

mcp = FastMCP("StaticResources")

notice = TextResource(
    uri="resource://notice",
    name="Important Notice",
    text="System maintenance scheduled for Sunday.",
    tags={"notification"},
)
mcp.add_resource(notice)

readme_path = Path("./README.md").resolve()
readme = FileResource(
    uri=f"file://{readme_path.as_posix()}",
    path=readme_path,
    name="README File",
    description="The project's README.",
    mime_type="text/markdown",
    tags={"documentation"},
)
mcp.add_resource(readme)
```

The value case for `add_resource(...)` is deterministic assembly: plugin systems, mounted file/URL resources, programmatic registration from config, and bound-method/resource-library composition all become easier when registration is not coupled to inline decorator use. ([FastMCP][2])

### 7.4 Standalone `@resource(...)` for methods and reusable callables

FastMCP also exposes a standalone decorator in `fastmcp.resources.function_resource`: `resource(uri: str) -> Callable[[F], F]`. Its SDK page says it returns the original function with metadata attached and is meant to be registered later via `mcp.add_resource()`. The prose guide explicitly recommends this pattern for instance or class methods, mirroring the tool-method pattern. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="55d6lg"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.resources import resource

class RepoReader:
    def __init__(self, org: str):
        self.org = org

    @resource("repo://{name}/info")
    def get_repo(self, name: str) -> str:
        return f"{self.org}/{name}"

reader = RepoReader("PrefectHQ")
mcp = FastMCP("RepoServer")
mcp.add_resource(reader.get_repo)
```

This pattern matters because resource registration should see the **bound** signature, not `self` or `cls` as client-supplied URI/function parameters. ([FastMCP][3])

### 7.5 Return contract for resources

The prose docs define the conservative public contract as: resource functions should return `str`, `bytes`, or `ResourceResult`. `str` is emitted as text content with default `text/plain`; `bytes` becomes blob/binary content and should usually have an explicit MIME type; `ResourceResult` gives full control over multi-item content and metadata. The same guide advises that if you want to expose structured data like dicts or lists, you should explicitly `json.dumps()` them rather than returning raw objects, because that catches schema/content mistakes earlier in development. ([FastMCP][1])

There is one implementation nuance worth documenting explicitly for agents: the `FunctionResource` SDK reference says that the wrapped function can return `str`, `bytes`, or “other types,” with other types converted to JSON. That is slightly more permissive than the prose guide. The safest authoring rule is therefore: **treat explicit `str`/`bytes`/`ResourceResult` as the documented public contract, and use explicit JSON serialization for dict/list returns unless you intentionally want to rely on the SDK’s JSON-conversion path**. ([FastMCP][3])

### 7.6 `ResourceResult` and `ResourceContent`

`ResourceResult` is the explicit response envelope for resources. The docs define `contents` as `str | bytes | list[ResourceContent]`, with strings/bytes automatically wrapped into single content items, and `meta` as result-level metadata emitted into the MCP response’s `_meta` field. `ResourceContent` carries `content`, optional `mime_type`, and optional item-level `meta`; non-string/non-bytes values placed in `ResourceContent.content` are JSON-serialized automatically. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="d1g2zd"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.resources import ResourceResult, ResourceContent

mcp = FastMCP("RichResources")

@mcp.resource("data://users")
def get_users() -> ResourceResult:
    return ResourceResult(
        contents=[
            ResourceContent(content='[{"id": 1}]', mime_type="application/json"),
            ResourceContent(content="# Users\n...", mime_type="text/markdown"),
        ],
        meta={"total": 1},
    )
```

Use `ResourceResult` when one resource read should emit multiple content variants, custom MIME typing, CSP/caching hints, or other per-response metadata. Use plain `str`/`bytes` when the resource is single-payload and format-simple. ([FastMCP][1])

### 7.7 MCP `Context` inside resources

Resources and templates can request `Context` by adding a parameter annotated as `Context`. The resources guide shows both fixed-URI and template resources using `ctx: Context` to access request information, and the server SDK states that a `Context` parameter is optional and provides access to MCP features like logging, progress reporting, and session information. This parameter is runtime infrastructure, not client-supplied URI data. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="h4h92s"
import json
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP("ContextResources")

@mcp.resource("resource://system-status")
async def get_system_status(ctx: Context) -> str:
    return json.dumps({"status": "operational", "request_id": ctx.request_id})
```

### 7.8 Async resources and sync resource execution

FastMCP supports both `async def` and `def` resource functions. The resources guide states that synchronous resource functions are automatically run in a threadpool to avoid blocking the event loop, while async functions are the better fit for I/O-bound work such as async file reads, DB/network calls, or other awaitable pipelines. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="jlwmco"
import aiofiles
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("AsyncResources")

@mcp.resource("file:///app/data/important_log.txt", mime_type="text/plain")
async def read_important_log() -> str:
    async with aiofiles.open("/app/data/important_log.txt", mode="r") as f:
        return await f.read()
```

### 7.9 Direct resource classes

The direct concrete resource classes documented by FastMCP are `TextResource`, `BinaryResource`, `FileResource`, `HttpResource`, and `DirectoryResource`; the resource guide also notes `FunctionResource` as the internal class used by `@mcp.resource`. This split is important: `FunctionResource` is the lazy function wrapper; the others are concrete source-specific primitives. ([FastMCP][1])

#### `TextResource`

`TextResource` is the simplest concrete resource: string content already known at registration time. The SDK describes it as “a resource that reads from a string.” Use it for notices, banners, embedded help text, generated-but-static manifests, and similar immutable or rarely changing text payloads. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="otvc6f"
from fastmcp.resources import TextResource

notice = TextResource(
    uri="resource://notice",
    name="Important Notice",
    text="System maintenance scheduled for Sunday.",
    tags={"notification"},
)
```

#### `BinaryResource`

`BinaryResource` is the bytes analogue of `TextResource`. The SDK describes it as a resource that reads from bytes. Use it when the payload is already in memory and should not be re-read from disk or fetched over HTTP. Explicit MIME typing is advisable for any non-generic binary content. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="e5ybo3"
from fastmcp.resources import BinaryResource

logo = BinaryResource(
    uri="resource://logo",
    name="Logo",
    data=b"...binary bytes...",
    mime_type="image/png",
)
```

#### `FileResource`

`FileResource` reads from a local file path. The SDK says it enforces an **absolute** path, supports `is_binary=True` for binary reads, and can infer binary mode from MIME type if `is_binary` is not set explicitly; the prose guide adds that it handles text/binary modes, encoding, and lazy reading. Use it when the resource should be backed by an actual file rather than by a function wrapper. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="j3npe2"
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp.resources import FileResource

readme_path = Path("./README.md").resolve()

readme = FileResource(
    uri=f"file://{readme_path.as_posix()}",
    path=readme_path,
    name="README File",
    description="The project's README.",
    mime_type="text/markdown",
    tags={"documentation"},
)
```

#### `HttpResource`

`HttpResource` is the URL-backed direct resource. The SDK describes it as “a resource that reads from an HTTP endpoint,” and the prose guide notes that it requires `httpx`. Use it when the external HTTP content should be modeled as a readable MCP resource, not as an imperative tool call. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="jlwmzu"
from fastmcp.resources import HttpResource

remote_schema = HttpResource(
    uri="https://example.com/schema.json",
    name="Remote Schema",
    description="Schema fetched from an external HTTP endpoint.",
)
```

#### `DirectoryResource`

`DirectoryResource` lists files in a directory. The SDK says it enforces an absolute path and provides `list_files()` plus `read()`; the resource guide’s example shows `recursive=False` and states that reads return a JSON list of files. Use it when discoverability of directory contents is itself the resource payload. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="tzr5yd"
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp.resources import DirectoryResource

data_dir = Path("./app_data").resolve()

listing = DirectoryResource(
    uri="resource://data-files",
    path=data_dir,
    name="Data Directory Listing",
    description="Lists files available in the data directory.",
    recursive=False,
)
```

### 7.10 Notifications

FastMCP automatically emits `notifications/resources/list_changed` when resources or templates are added, enabled, or disabled. The docs also give the critical caveat: notifications are only sent if those operations happen inside an active MCP request context, such as inside a tool or other MCP operation. Changes during server initialization do **not** emit notifications. This is a runtime/UI synchronization feature, not a startup manifest signal. ([FastMCP][1])

Operationally, this means dynamic resource topology changes performed in response to client activity can drive reactive UIs or auto-refreshing clients, but boot-time registration should still be treated as static startup state. ([FastMCP][1])

### 7.11 Annotations

Resources support `annotations=` on `@mcp.resource(...)`. The documented standard annotation keys are `readOnlyHint` and `idempotentHint`, both advisory hints intended to improve client behavior and UI without consuming prompt tokens. The docs explicitly say these hints are **advisory**, not enforcement mechanisms. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="5plkdf"
@mcp.resource(
    "data://config",
    annotations={
        "readOnlyHint": True,
        "idempotentHint": True,
    },
)
def get_config() -> str:
    return '{"version": "1.0", "debug": false}'
```

For LLM-agent authors, the practical rule is: keep annotations semantically honest. Marking a resource `readOnlyHint=True` or `idempotentHint=True` helps clients optimize caching, display, and invocation UX, but it does not create a security or correctness boundary. ([FastMCP][1])

### 7.12 Resource templates: declaration and classification

Resource templates are created with the same `@mcp.resource(...)` decorator, but the URI contains placeholders like `{city}` or `{owner}/{repo}` and the backing function signature includes corresponding parameters. The docs say templates share most regular resource options—`name`, `description`, `mime_type`, `tags`, `annotations`, `meta`—but add URI parameter mapping and generate a concrete resource for each unique parameter set on demand. The server SDK also says that if the URI contains parameters **or** the function has parameters, the registration is treated as a template resource. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="g1h9mw"
import json
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("TemplateServer")

@mcp.resource("weather://{city}/current")
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return json.dumps({
        "city": city.capitalize(),
        "temperature": 22,
        "condition": "Sunny",
    })
```

The docs also call out one signature asymmetry relative to tools: `*args` are not supported for resource templates, but `**kwargs` **are** supported because the URI template defines the exact parameter names that will be collected and passed as keyword arguments. That makes templates more flexible than tools in one narrow but important dimension. ([FastMCP][1])

### 7.13 RFC 6570 support: simple params, wildcards, query params

FastMCP implements RFC 6570 URI templates for resources, specifically supporting simple path parameters `{var}`, wildcard path parameters `{var*}`, and form-style query parameters `{?var1,var2}`. The SDK helper functions make that explicit: `extract_query_params(...)`, `build_regex(...)`, and `match_uri_template(...)` all operate on this subset. ([FastMCP][1])

#### Simple path parameters: `{var}`

A standard parameter matches exactly one URI path segment and does not cross `/` boundaries. Use it for stable one-segment identifiers like city names, IDs, or top-level keys. ([FastMCP][1])

#### Wildcard parameters: `{var*}`

Wildcard parameters capture multiple path segments, including slashes. The docs state they capture all subsequent path segments until the next literal/template boundary and that multiple wildcard parameters can exist in one template. This makes them appropriate for file paths, nested keys, repository paths, or REST-like hierarchical identifiers. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="n44sk2"
@mcp.resource("files://{filename}")
def get_file(filename: str) -> str:
    return f"single segment: {filename}"

@mcp.resource("path://{filepath*}")
def get_path_content(filepath: str) -> str:
    return f"multi segment: {filepath}"

@mcp.resource("repo://{owner}/{path*}/template.py")
def get_template_file(owner: str, path: str) -> dict:
    return {"owner": owner, "path": path + "/template.py"}
```

#### Query parameters: `{?param1,param2}`

FastMCP supports RFC 6570 form-style query parameters via `{?param1,param2}`. The docs are strict here: query parameters must map to **optional** function parameters with default values, while path parameters map to required parameters. This is the clean separation rule: required data belongs in the path; optional configuration belongs in the query string. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="fby7kx"
@mcp.resource("data://{id}{?format}")
def get_data(id: str, format: str = "json") -> str:
    if format == "xml":
        return f"<data id='{id}' />"
    return f'{{"id": "{id}"}}'

@mcp.resource("api://{endpoint}{?version,limit,offset}")
def call_api(endpoint: str, version: int = 1, limit: int = 10, offset: int = 0) -> dict:
    return {
        "endpoint": endpoint,
        "version": version,
        "limit": limit,
        "offset": offset,
    }
```

### 7.14 Type coercion for template/query parameters

The resource-template docs state that query-parameter values are automatically coerced from strings to the annotated parameter types based on the function signature, explicitly calling out `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`. This is a resource-side analogue of tool input coercion, but scoped to URI-extracted parameters instead of JSON request bodies. ([FastMCP][1])

A high-value corollary is also documented: optional parameters omitted from the URI template are **hidden defaults**. If a parameter has a default but is not included in `{?query}` or another path slot, clients cannot override it and the function always uses the default value. This is the cleanest way to keep runtime knobs internal without reaching for a separate dependency-injection mechanism. ([FastMCP][1])

### 7.15 Template validation rules

FastMCP enforces three template-creation rules:

1. required function parameters (no defaults) must appear in the URI **path** template;
2. query parameters declared via `{?param}` must be optional function parameters with defaults;
3. every URI-template parameter, whether path or query, must exist in the function signature. ([FastMCP][1])

The same section also documents what optional parameters may do:

* appear as query parameters, exposing them to clients;
* be omitted from the template, making them fixed internal defaults;
* be used in alternative path templates, allowing multiple URI patterns for the same function. ([FastMCP][1])

That third case is particularly useful for compatibility layers or dual-lookup resources. The docs show manually applying multiple decorators to one function, e.g. `users://email/{email}` and `users://name/{name}` bound to a single implementation. ([FastMCP][1])

### 7.16 Matching internals and validation helpers

For custom providers, testing, or debugging, the SDK exposes three resource-template helper functions:

* `extract_query_params(uri_template: str) -> set[str]`
* `build_regex(template: str) -> re.Pattern[str] | None`
* `match_uri_template(uri: str, uri_template: str) -> dict[str, str] | None` ([FastMCP][5])

`build_regex(...)` understands `{var}`, `{var*}`, and `{?var1,var2}`, ignoring query parameters during path matching. It returns `None` when the resulting regex would be invalid—for example, when parameter names contain hyphens, start with digits, or create duplicates coming from a remote server. `match_uri_template(...)` then performs the full URI match and extracts both path and query parameters. This is the implementation-level contract behind template resolution, and it is the correct primitive when writing custom template-aware providers or test harnesses. ([FastMCP][5])

### 7.17 Best-practice deployment and authoring guidance

Prefer a **resource** over a **tool** when the capability is read-only, addressable by URI, and semantically cacheable/idempotent; prefer a **tool** when the operation is imperative, side-effecting, conversationally parameterized, or not naturally modeled as “read this URI.” FastMCP’s own docs frame resources as read-only data/file access and tools as executable capabilities, so that split should be encoded into agent design heuristics. ([FastMCP][1])

Prefer `@mcp.resource(...)` for function-backed dynamic content and use concrete classes like `TextResource`, `FileResource`, `HttpResource`, or `DirectoryResource` when the content source is already a stable object/file/URL and does not need a dedicated function body. The resource guide explicitly presents that as the division of labor. ([FastMCP][1])

Prefer explicit `mime_type=` for any binary or non-obvious textual content. The docs repeatedly note that MIME type can be inferred, but they also recommend explicit values for non-text or specialized content; `FileResource` and `BinaryResource` in particular benefit from explicit typing. ([FastMCP][1])

Use absolute filesystem paths for `FileResource` and `DirectoryResource`. The SDK pages enforce absolute-path validation, so relative-path registration should be normalized with `.resolve()` at build time rather than left ambiguous. ([FastMCP][4])

For template design, keep required identifiers in path segments and optional knobs in `{?query}` parameters; omit optional parameters from the URI template entirely when they should remain hidden defaults. The docs define exactly this separation and even contrast configurable-via-query and fixed-default examples. ([FastMCP][1])

If a client UI needs to react to runtime resource topology changes, perform add/enable/disable operations inside an active MCP request context so `notifications/resources/list_changed` will be emitted. Initialization-time registration will not notify clients. ([FastMCP][1])

# FastMCP Advanced — 8) Prompts and prompt rendering
### Prompts and prompt rendering

**FastMCP 4 status.** Prompt fundamentals remain, but background `task=` is no longer supported on prompts. Argument completion is now a first-class server capability through `@mcp.completion` (see §41).


### 8.0 Prompt model: definition-time contract vs render-time contract

Prompts are reusable, parameterized message templates. When a client requests a prompt, FastMCP locates the prompt definition, validates any arguments against the function signature, executes the function, and returns the generated message sequence to the LLM. By default, the prompt name comes from the Python function name and the prompt description comes from the function docstring. Functions with `*args` or `**kwargs` are not supported because FastMCP must generate a complete MCP parameter schema for the prompt surface. ([FastMCP][1])

For agent authors, the operational split is: **definition-time metadata** controls what shows up in `prompts/list`; **render-time output** controls the concrete message sequence returned by `get_prompt`/`render_prompt`. Those are related but not the same object. `FastMCP.get_prompt(...)` returns a prompt definition filtered through visibility/version rules, while `FastMCP.render_prompt(...)` executes the prompt and returns a `PromptResult` (or a task handle when backgrounded). ([FastMCP][2])

### 8.1 `@mcp.prompt` — direct registration surface

The primary registration surface is `@mcp.prompt`. The server SDK documents the supported calling patterns as `@server.prompt`, `@server.prompt()`, `@server.prompt("custom_name")`, `@server.prompt(name="custom_name")`, and direct function registration `server.prompt(function, name="custom_name")`. The prompt function may also request `Context` by type annotation. ([FastMCP][2])

Minimal direct-registration form:

```python id="5n6qk7"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.prompts import Message

mcp = FastMCP(name="PromptServer")

@mcp.prompt
def ask_about_topic(topic: str) -> str:
    """Generates a user message asking for an explanation of a topic."""
    return f"Can you please explain the concept of '{topic}'?"

@mcp.prompt
def generate_code_request(language: str, task_description: str) -> list[Message]:
    """Generates a conversation for code generation."""
    return [
        Message(f"Write a {language} function that performs the following task: {task_description}"),
        Message("I'll help you write that function.", role="assistant"),
    ]
```

That shape is the canonical MCP prompt declaration pattern: prompt identifier from function name unless overridden, parameter schema from the signature, and render contract from the return type. ([FastMCP][1])

### 8.2 `mcp.add_prompt(...)` and standalone `@prompt()` for methods

`FastMCP.add_prompt(...)` is the programmatic registration API. The server SDK defines it as accepting either a `Prompt` instance or an `@prompt`-decorated function and returning the registered `Prompt`. This is the correct entrypoint for composition, plugin discovery, bound-method registration, and server assembly from external component libraries. ([FastMCP][2])

The standalone decorator lives at `fastmcp.prompts.function_prompt.prompt(...)`. Its SDK page says it marks a function as an MCP prompt, returns the original function with metadata attached, and is meant to be registered later via `mcp.add_prompt()`. This is the correct pattern for instance/class methods, because immediate `@mcp.prompt` registration would see `self`/`cls` at decoration time instead of the later bound method signature. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="72t62r"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.prompts import Message
from fastmcp.prompts import prompt

class Reviewer:
    def __init__(self, style: str):
        self.style = style

    @prompt()
    def review_request(self, code: str) -> list[Message]:
        return [
            Message(f"Review this code in {self.style} style:\n\n{code}"),
            Message("I will review the code now.", role="assistant"),
        ]

reviewer = Reviewer(style="security-focused")

mcp = FastMCP("ReviewServer")
mcp.add_prompt(reviewer.review_request)
```

For method-based prompts, that separation is the safe contract: standalone `@prompt()` attaches metadata; `mcp.add_prompt(bound_method)` publishes the correct bound signature. ([FastMCP][3])

### 8.3 Prompt decorator arguments: public docs surface and current SDK surface

The main prompts guide documents these decorator arguments: `name`, `title`, `description`, `tags`, deprecated `enabled`, `icons`, `meta`, and `version`. Semantically: `name` overrides the exposed MCP prompt name, `title` is a human-readable title, `description` overrides the docstring-derived description, `tags` categorize prompts, `icons` attach presentation metadata, `meta` is static prompt-definition metadata surfaced to clients, and `version` is the dedicated component-version field introduced in `3.0.0`. The guide explicitly marks `enabled` deprecated in v3 and directs users to server-level `mcp.enable()` / `mcp.disable()` instead. ([FastMCP][1])

The lower-level prompt decorator reference for `LocalProvider` lists a slightly broader current surface: in addition to `name`, `title`, `description`, `icons`, `tags`, deprecated `enabled`, and `meta`, it also lists `task` and `auth` as supported decorator kwargs. For agent-authored docs/code, the safest framing is: the prose guide highlights the common user-facing fields, while the SDK reference exposes the broader current decorator surface used by the runtime. ([FastMCP][4])

Representative explicit-decorator form:

```python id="s83kzd"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("PromptServer")

@mcp.prompt(
    name="analyze_data_request",
    title="Analyze Data Request",
    description="Creates a request to analyze data with specific parameters.",
    tags={"analysis", "data"},
    meta={"owner": "data-team", "stability": "ga"},
    version="2.0",
)
def data_analysis_prompt(data_uri: str, analysis_type: str = "summary") -> str:
    return f"Please perform a '{analysis_type}' analysis on the data found at {data_uri}."
```

If `description=` is supplied, the function docstring is ignored for prompt-description purposes. If it is omitted, the docstring becomes the prompt’s description in MCP listings. ([FastMCP][1])

### 8.4 Typed prompt arguments: string-on-the-wire, typed-in-Python

Prompt arguments have a special transport rule: MCP prompt arguments are passed as **strings** at the protocol layer, but FastMCP lets you annotate the Python function with richer types and performs server-side conversion. The prompts guide explicitly documents this for complex types like `list[int]` and `dict[str, str]`: FastMCP converts incoming strings to the annotated Python types, augments prompt argument descriptions with JSON-schema-like formatting guidance, and still lets you call the prompt directly in Python with properly typed values. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="l8rnyr"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("TypedPrompts")

@mcp.prompt
def analyze_data(
    numbers: list[int],
    metadata: dict[str, str],
    threshold: float,
) -> str:
    avg = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return f"Average: {avg}, above threshold: {avg > threshold}"
```

At the protocol layer, a client sends:

```json id="1xtzyv"
{
  "numbers": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",
  "metadata": "{\"source\": \"api\", \"version\": \"1.0\"}",
  "threshold": "2.5"
}
```

But direct Python-side rendering can still use typed values. The docs also warn to keep prompt argument types simple: `list[int]`, `dict[str, str]`, `float`, and `bool` are good candidates; deeply nested custom structures or complex Pydantic models may not convert reliably from JSON strings because the only guidance clients/LLMs receive is the generated argument description. ([FastMCP][1])

Required-vs-optional behavior follows normal Python signature rules: parameters without defaults are required; parameters with defaults are optional. FastMCP uses that distinction when exposing prompt arguments through MCP. ([FastMCP][1])

### 8.5 No `*args` / `**kwargs`: prompt schema must be total

FastMCP explicitly forbids `*args` and `**kwargs` in prompt functions. The reason is the same as for tools but even sharper here because prompt arguments are listed in MCP as named prompt parameters: FastMCP must emit a complete parameter schema, and variable argument lists cannot be represented as a stable, machine-readable contract for clients. ([FastMCP][1])

For agent-authored code, the design rule is: expose a fixed prompt schema with explicit parameter names and defaults. If internal logic wants variadic flexibility, hide it behind a stable wrapper prompt function rather than attempting to surface a variadic Python signature directly. ([FastMCP][1])

### 8.6 Return contract: `str`, `list[Message | str]`, or `PromptResult`

The prompt return contract is intentionally narrow. The docs define the only supported prompt-function return shapes as:

* `str`: sent as a single user message
* `list[Message | str]`: a conversation/message sequence; strings are auto-converted to user messages
* `PromptResult`: full control over messages, description, and runtime metadata. ([FastMCP][1])

That same contract is repeated in the prompt base SDK: `Prompt.from_function(...)` and `Prompt.render(...)` both describe those three accepted return classes, and `Prompt.convert_result(...)` is the adapter that normalizes them into `PromptResult`, raising `TypeError` for unsupported return types. ([FastMCP][5])

Minimal forms:

```python id="p44jih"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.prompts import Message, PromptResult

mcp = FastMCP("PromptServer")

@mcp.prompt
def simple(topic: str) -> str:
    return f"Explain {topic}"

@mcp.prompt
def dialogue(topic: str) -> list[Message | str]:
    return [
        f"Explain {topic}",
        Message("I can help with that.", role="assistant"),
    ]

@mcp.prompt
def rich(topic: str) -> PromptResult:
    return PromptResult(
        messages=[
            Message(f"Explain {topic}"),
            Message("I will structure the explanation.", role="assistant"),
        ],
        description="Explanation prompt",
        meta={"category": "education"},
    )
```

This is the full public render contract. Anything else must be explicitly transformed into one of these forms before returning. ([FastMCP][1])

### 8.7 `Message` — canonical prompt-message primitive

In v3-style FastMCP, the canonical prompt message type is `fastmcp.prompts.Message`, not `mcp.types.PromptMessage`. The upgrade guide is explicit: prompt functions now use `Message`, which defaults `role="user"` and accepts plain strings directly; the same guide also says raw dicts with `role`/`content` keys were silently coerced in v2 but should be replaced in v3 with `Message` objects or plain strings for single-user messages. ([GitHub][6])

The prompt base SDK and the prompts guide define `Message` as a wrapper with two fields:

* `content`: any content; strings pass through, while dict/list/BaseModel values are JSON-serialized to text
* `role`: `"user"` or `"assistant"`, default `"user"`. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="ty6r3f"
from fastmcp.prompts import Message

Message("Hello")                              # user role
Message("I can help.", role="assistant")      # assistant role
Message({"task": "summarize"})                # JSON-serialized to text
```

The important distinction is: `Message(content=<dict>)` is valid because the dict becomes text content inside a typed message wrapper; returning a raw dict in place of a `Message` object is no longer the intended v3 contract. ([GitHub][6])

### 8.8 `PromptResult` — render-time control plane

`PromptResult` is the canonical explicit result type for prompt rendering. The prompts guide defines its fields as `messages`, `description`, and `meta`. `messages` can be a string or a list of `Message`; strings are wrapped as a single user message. `description` is optional and, if omitted, defaults to the prompt’s docstring. `meta` is result-level runtime metadata and is placed into the MCP response’s `_meta` field. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="fyh8zs"
from fastmcp.prompts import PromptResult, Message

PromptResult(
    messages=[
        Message("Please review this code."),
        Message("I will check correctness, style, and security.", role="assistant"),
    ],
    description="Code review prompt",
    meta={"review_type": "security", "priority": "high"},
)
```

The base SDK also describes `PromptResult` as the explicit-control render type and exposes `to_mcp_prompt_result()` for conversion into the wire-level MCP result object. For agent authors, treat `PromptResult` as the “escape hatch” when plain `str` or `list[Message]` is insufficient because you need per-render description or per-render metadata. ([FastMCP][5])

### 8.9 Static prompt metadata vs runtime prompt-result metadata

FastMCP has two separate metadata planes for prompts, and confusing them produces poor client behavior.

* `@mcp.prompt(meta={...})` is **static definition metadata**. The prompts guide says this is passed through to the client-side prompt object’s `meta` field and can be used for custom metadata, versioning hints, or other application-specific prompt catalog information. This is what clients see when listing prompts. ([FastMCP][1])
* `PromptResult(meta={...})` is **runtime render metadata**. The prompts guide says this is included in the MCP response’s `_meta` field and is meant for per-render metadata such as categorization, priority, or other client-specific runtime data. It explicitly distinguishes this from decorator-level `meta`. ([FastMCP][1])

That means the correct split is:

* stable catalog metadata, ownership, UI hints, rollout labels, etc. → decorator `meta=...`
* per-render classification, priority, execution markers, dynamic tags, etc. → `PromptResult.meta` ([FastMCP][1])

Likewise, static `description=` on the decorator describes the prompt definition exposed via MCP listing, while `PromptResult.description` describes a specific render result. They live at different layers of the protocol. ([FastMCP][1])

### 8.10 Async prompts and `Context`

FastMCP supports both synchronous and asynchronous prompt functions. The prompts guide states that `def` prompts are automatically run in a threadpool to avoid blocking the event loop, while `async def` is preferable for I/O-bound work such as database or network access. ([FastMCP][1])

Prompts can also request `Context` by type annotation. The prompts guide says adding a `Context` parameter gives access to request-local MCP information and features such as request IDs and other context utilities. As with tools/resources, `Context` is a runtime-injected infrastructure parameter, not a client-supplied prompt argument. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="rbukdk"
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP(name="PromptServer")

@mcp.prompt
async def generate_report_request(report_type: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    return f"Please create a {report_type} report. Request ID: {ctx.request_id}"
```

### 8.11 Rendering APIs: definition lookup vs execution

At the server API layer, `get_prompt(name, version=None)` retrieves the prompt definition without rendering it; `render_prompt(name, arguments=None, version=None, ...)` performs the actual render and returns a `PromptResult` by default. The server SDK documents both, and also notes that middleware is applied by default when rendering. ([FastMCP][2])

The current SDK also exposes a background-execution pathway for prompts. `render_prompt(...)` can return `PromptResult | CreateTaskResult` depending on whether `task_meta` is supplied, and the local-provider prompt decorator reference lists `task` as an optional decorator configuration field for background execution. For most prompt workloads this is unnecessary, but it is part of the current prompt object model. ([FastMCP][2])

### 8.12 Versioning: multiple implementations, one public name

Prompt versioning is a first-class feature in v3. The prompts guide says prompts support versioning, allowing you to maintain multiple implementations under the same name while clients automatically receive the highest version by default. The decorator-level `version=` field is the dedicated version identifier for this purpose. ([FastMCP][1])

The server SDK gives the operational lookup rules:

* `get_prompt(name, version=None)` returns the highest enabled version when no explicit version is requested
* if the highest version is disabled and no explicit version is requested, FastMCP falls back to the next-highest enabled version
* `render_prompt(name, ..., version=...)` can target a specific version instead of the default highest version. ([FastMCP][2])

Representative registration pattern:

```python id="jlwmog"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("VersionedPrompts")

@mcp.prompt(name="summarize", version="1.0")
def summarize_v1(text: str) -> str:
    return f"Summarize this text:\n\n{text}"

@mcp.prompt(name="summarize", version="2.0")
def summarize_v2(text: str, style: str = "concise") -> str:
    return f"Summarize this text in a {style} style:\n\n{text}"
```

With that definition set, default prompt retrieval/rendering uses `2.0`, while explicit version selection can target `1.0`. This is the correct migration pattern when you need to evolve a prompt contract without breaking existing clients or workflows. ([FastMCP][1])

Version comparison itself is not arbitrary string sorting. The version-utility SDK says versions are first parsed as PEP 440 where possible, falling back to lexicographic comparison for invalid/non-PEP-440 strings; `None` sorts lowest. Examples given by the SDK include `"1" < "2" < "10"` semantically, `"v1.0"` normalized to `"1.0"`, and date-like strings compared lexicographically if they are not valid PEP 440 versions. ([FastMCP][7])

For agent authors, the design implication is direct: use PEP-440-like version strings (`"1.0"`, `"2.1"`, `"3.0rc1"`) if you want predictable semantic ordering. Non-PEP-440 strings still work, but then ordering degrades to lexicographic behavior. ([FastMCP][7])

### 8.13 Best-practice prompt authoring rules for agents

Prefer `@mcp.prompt` for top-level prompt functions and standalone `@prompt()` plus `mcp.add_prompt(bound_method)` for methods. That preserves correct bound signatures and keeps `self`/`cls` out of the public prompt schema. ([FastMCP][3])

Keep prompt argument types simple and string-serializable from MCP clients. The prompt docs explicitly recommend simple lists/dicts/scalars and warn against complex nested/custom classes because prompt arguments arrive as strings and conversion guidance is description-driven. ([FastMCP][1])

Use `Message` and `PromptResult`, not legacy `mcp.types.PromptMessage` or raw dict prompt-message payloads. The upgrade guide makes that the v3 contract, and the prompt/message docs define the modern primitives clearly. ([GitHub][6])

Use decorator `meta=` for static catalog metadata and `PromptResult.meta` for per-render runtime metadata; do not mix the two planes. Use `version=` for actual component selection/version routing rather than stuffing version semantics into arbitrary `meta` fields. ([FastMCP][1])

Use versioning to evolve prompts under a stable public name instead of renaming prompts gratuitously. FastMCP already handles highest-version selection and explicit version targeting; stable names plus explicit versions make both human and machine clients easier to maintain. ([FastMCP][1])

# FastMCP Advanced — 9) MCP Context

## 9.0 FastMCP 4 context boundary

`Context` remains the request-scoped gateway to FastMCP runtime facilities, but v4 sharply distinguishes **request-local capabilities** from **cross-request application state** and removes server-initiated sampling/roots from the server API. ([Context][1]) ([Upgrade][2])

Current high-value context capabilities include logging, progress, resource/prompt access, request/session metadata, protocol version, authenticated/server access, request-local state, modern input responses, and sealed request state.

```text
Context
├─ request identity / protocol version / transport
├─ logging + progress
├─ resource/prompt access
├─ request-local state
├─ ctx.input_responses      # modern multi-round answers
├─ ctx.request_state        # sealed round-trip state
└─ legacy-only ctx.elicit() # handshake connections only

NOT on Context in v4:
├─ ctx.sample() / sample_step()
└─ ctx.list_roots()
```

## 9.1 Injection

The established `Context` injection patterns remain: a `Context`-typed parameter is injected and hidden from the MCP schema; explicit DI through `CurrentContext()` remains useful when you want the runtime dependency to be obvious in the signature.

```python
from fastmcp import Context, FastMCP
from fastmcp.dependencies import CurrentContext

mcp = FastMCP("Context Demo")

@mcp.tool
async def process(item_id: str, ctx: Context = CurrentContext()) -> dict:
    await ctx.info(f"processing {item_id}")
    return {"item_id": item_id, "protocol": str(ctx.request_context.protocol_version)}
```

## 9.2 Request-local state vs session state

In FastMCP 4, `ctx.set_state()` / `ctx.get_state()` should be treated as **request-scoped** state for coordination within one request (for example, middleware → tool). On the modern sessionless protocol, a later call is a new request and does not inherit this state. Cross-request state belongs in `UserSession`/`SessionId` (§11/§40) or a domain store. ([Sessions][3])

## 9.3 Modern input-response loop

On `2026-07-28`, a server cannot push an elicitation request while a tool is suspended. Instead a tool returns `InputRequiredResult`; the client answers and calls the tool again. The re-entered tool reads answers from `ctx.input_responses` and optional sealed state from `ctx.request_state`. ([Elicitation][4])

```python
from fastmcp import Context
from mcp.types import InputRequiredResult

@mcp.tool
async def interactive(ctx: Context) -> str | InputRequiredResult:
    if ctx.input_responses is None:
        return build_input_request()
    return consume(ctx.input_responses, ctx.request_state)
```

This is not continuation of a suspended coroutine. Every round executes from the top through middleware and authorization again.

## 9.4 Legacy `ctx.elicit()`

`ctx.elicit()` still exists for handshake-era connections (≤ `2025-11-25`) but **raises on `2026-07-28`**. Servers that intentionally support both patterns should branch on `ctx.request_context.protocol_version`; controlled clients can instead be pinned with `mode="legacy"`, but that is usually a transitional strategy.

## 9.5 Sampling and roots

`ctx.sample()`, `ctx.sample_step()`, and `ctx.list_roots()` are removed from FastMCP 4. Their old design depended on a live callback channel from server to client. Preferred replacements are:

* call an LLM directly from the server when the server owns generation;
* use a modern `InputRequiredResult` guard when the purpose is specifically to ask the caller/client to sample;
* take paths/roots as explicit tool arguments or ask for them via a guard. ([Upgrade][2])

## 9.6 Logging and progress

Client logging and progress remain request-scoped capabilities. Progress also integrates with the tasks extension for long-running tool execution. Treat notification support as negotiated client behavior and test target hosts.

## 9.7 Request-state security

`request_state` in modern multi-round tools is sealed and verified by the framework. Single-process deployments can use the ephemeral process key. Multi-replica deployments must configure shared `RequestStateSecurity` keys so a later round can land on another replica. Keys require at least 32 bytes of secret randomness and support rotation rings.

## 9.8 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Keep Context at the MCP adapter edge.
[ ] Treat ctx state as request-local on modern connections.
[ ] Use UserSession/SessionId for cross-request state.
[ ] Use InputRequiredResult for modern multi-round interaction.
[ ] Use ctx.elicit only on handshake-era connections.
[ ] Do not generate ctx.sample / ctx.list_roots in FastMCP 4.
[ ] Share request-state signing keys across replicas when guard rounds may move.
[ ] Re-run authorization/middleware safely on every guard round.

# FastMCP Advanced — 10) Dependency injection

## 10.0 FastMCP 4 DI model

Dependency injection remains the preferred way to keep runtime-only values out of public MCP schemas. `Depends`, `CurrentContext`, `CurrentRequest`, `CurrentAccessToken`, `CurrentFastMCP`, header/token helpers, and custom dependency graphs remain core. FastMCP 4 additionally introduces **call-argument binding** so a dependency can receive values from the MCP call without exposing the dependency itself. ([DI][1]) ([Release][2])

## 10.1 Public-schema invariant

A dependency parameter is not caller-controlled and does not appear in the generated tool schema. FastMCP filters attempts to override injected parameters before invocation. Use ordinary parameters for model/user inputs and DI for infrastructure, authenticated identity, services, config, and request objects.

## 10.2 Custom dependencies and per-request caching

`Depends(factory)` still supports sync/async factories, nested dependencies, and async context managers. Shared subdependencies are cached per request, which is especially useful for DB sessions and API clients.

## 10.3 Binding dependencies to call arguments

FastMCP 4 can bind dependency arguments from the tool call it serves. The release example is conceptually:

```python
from fastmcp.dependencies import Depends, CallArgument

async def get_account(user_id: str):
    ...

@mcp.tool
async def update_account(
    owner: str,
    account = Depends(get_account, user_id=CallArgument("owner")),
):
    ...
```

`owner` remains the public MCP argument. `account` stays hidden, while DI receives the validated `owner` value. This is preferable to manually reading raw request arguments inside a dependency.

## 10.4 Task-specific dependencies

`Progress` remains in FastMCP's dependency surface. Docket-specific `CurrentDocket` and `CurrentWorker` moved to `fastmcp_tasks.dependencies`; task runtime is no longer core server state and requires the tasks package/extension.

## 10.5 Security rules

Use `CurrentAccessToken()` / token-claim helpers for caller identity instead of allowing the model to submit user IDs or roles. Call-argument binding is appropriate for **domain selection** but not a replacement for validating that the authenticated principal may access the selected object.

## 10.6 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Public business inputs are normal typed args.
[ ] Runtime infrastructure is DI.
[ ] Sensitive identity comes from validated auth, not caller arguments.
[ ] Use CallArgument when a hidden dependency legitimately depends on a public tool arg.
[ ] Keep request-owned context managers request-scoped; keep shared pools in lifespan.
[ ] Import Docket-specific dependencies from fastmcp_tasks.dependencies.

# FastMCP Advanced — 11) Lifespans, request state, session state, storage, and state ownership

## 11.0 FastMCP 4 state taxonomy

FastMCP 4 makes state ownership more explicit because the modern protocol is sessionless. Use this taxonomy:

```text
immutable declaration state  -> server/providers/transforms/extensions
server lifespan state        -> process lifetime, shared within replica
request Context state        -> one request only
request_state                -> sealed value carried across modern guard rounds
UserSession                  -> one authenticated bucket per user
SessionId + SessionProvider  -> named/multiple buckets per user, caller passes id
domain database state        -> durable business truth
task backend state           -> task status/progress/context snapshots
```

## 11.1 Lifespan

Lifespans still own expensive process-local resources: pools, reusable HTTP clients, models, caches, extension-owned workers. Cleanup belongs in `finally`. Mounted child lifespans run as part of the composed runtime tree.

## 11.2 Request context state

Use `ctx.set_state/get_state/delete_state` only for values that must coordinate code **within one request**. On modern `2026-07-28`, every call is fresh; context state does not persist across calls.

## 11.3 Per-user state with `UserSession`

Use `UserSession` when an authenticated user needs one implicit bucket. It is injected, hidden from the tool schema, and keyed by authenticated identity. It requires authentication.

```python
from fastmcp.server.sessions import UserSession

@mcp.tool
async def remember(fact: str, session: UserSession) -> str:
    facts = await session.get("facts", default=[])
    facts.append(fact)
    await session.set("facts", facts)
    return f"Remembered {len(facts)} facts"
```

## 11.4 Multiple explicit sessions with `SessionId`

Use `SessionId` when one user can own several workflows/carts/conversations. Register `SessionProvider()` so the server exposes session creation/end functionality, then resolve the caller-supplied id with `get_session()`.

```python
from fastmcp.server.sessions import SessionId, SessionProvider
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_session

mcp.add_provider(SessionProvider())

@mcp.tool
async def add_to_cart(item: str, session_id: SessionId) -> str:
    session = await get_session(session_id)
    cart = await session.get("cart", default=[])
    cart.append(item)
    await session.set("cart", cart)
    return f"{len(cart)} items"
```

`SessionId` is specifically FastMCP's create-then-pass contract. If your application already owns conversation/workflow identifiers, use ordinary IDs and your domain storage instead.

## 11.5 Isolation

Authenticated sessions are keyed first by user, then session id. A session id alone is not authority. On unauthenticated deployments, explicit session ids are bearer handles and should only be considered safe in single-tenant/trusted-client environments.

## 11.6 Storage and expiry

Session state uses `session_state_store`, in-memory by default. Use Redis or another shared `AsyncKeyValue` store for multi-replica/state-surviving deployments. FastMCP does not impose a session TTL itself; configure expiry in the storage layer.

## 11.7 Request state vs session state

Use sealed `request_state` to carry a **small value across the rounds of one logical interactive tool call**. Use `UserSession`/`SessionId` for state that spans independent calls. Do not substitute either for durable business records.

## 11.8 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Classify state before choosing storage.
[ ] Never rely on a modern HTTP connection object for cross-call state.
[ ] Use UserSession for one authenticated per-user bucket.
[ ] Use SessionId + SessionProvider for multiple explicit per-user sessions.
[ ] Use shared session storage across replicas.
[ ] Use request_state only for small multi-round guard continuity.
[ ] Configure a shared request-state key across replicas.
[ ] Keep durable business truth in its domain store.

# FastMCP Advanced — 12) Background tasks and long-running workflows

## 12.0 FastMCP 4 task architecture

Background tasks moved out of the core MCP spec into the negotiated **`io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension (SEP-2663)**. FastMCP 4 implements that extension through the separate `fastmcp-tasks` package while retaining Docket as the execution engine. ([Tasks][1])

```text
FastMCP core
   + fastmcp-tasks package
   + TasksExtension registered on the root server
   + @mcp.tool(task=True)
      -> modern client negotiates extension
      -> task runs in Docket worker
```

## 12.1 Installation and registration

```bash
pip install "fastmcp[tasks]==4.0.0"
```

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp_tasks import TasksExtension

mcp = FastMCP("Worker")
mcp.add_extension(TasksExtension())

@mcp.tool(task=True)
async def slow_computation(duration: int) -> str:
    ...
```

A `task=True` tool without a registered tasks extension fails at server startup. Task-enabled components must be async. **Only tools** support `task=` in v4; the v3 resource/template/prompt task surface is removed.

## 12.2 `TaskConfig`

Import from `fastmcp.utilities.tasks`. Modes remain `forbidden`, `optional`, and `required`. On a legacy connection, tasks are not negotiated and an optional tool runs synchronously. On a modern connection with task support, optional/required modes can task the call.

## 12.3 Client API change

The v3 pattern `client.call_tool(..., task=True)` is removed. In v4, normal `client.call_tool(...)` transparently follows a task to completion and returns the same final result shape. To receive a task handle immediately, import the task helper from `fastmcp_tasks`:

```python
import fastmcp_tasks  # enables client task support
from fastmcp_tasks import call_tool_task

async with Client(server) as client:
    task = await call_tool_task(client, "slow_computation", {"duration": 10})
    result = await task.result()
```

Task support is modern-protocol-only. A client pinned to `mode="legacy"` never negotiates the extension.

## 12.4 Backends and workers

`memory://` remains convenient for local/single-process work; Redis/Valkey is the production path for durability, low pickup latency, and horizontal workers. Register task-enabled tools at startup so every worker can discover them.

## 12.5 Credentials at rest

FastMCP snapshots caller identity and inbound HTTP context so workers can execute with the submitting principal. Redis/Valkey therefore becomes a sensitive credential store. Set `FASTMCP_TASKS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; without it, the task context snapshot is stored as plaintext JSON. Key mismatch/decryption fails closed. Tool arguments and collected answers are still sensitive even when the identity snapshot is encrypted.

## 12.6 Interactive tasks

Task workers must not block on imperative `ctx.elicit()`. Use the same guard pattern as modern foreground tools: return `InputRequiredResult`, let the task enter `input_required`, then resume on a new execution leg after the client answers.

## 12.7 Progress and Docket dependencies

`Progress` remains the portable dependency. `CurrentDocket` and `CurrentWorker` live in `fastmcp_tasks.dependencies`.

## 12.8 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Install fastmcp[tasks] and register TasksExtension.
[ ] Use task= only on async tools.
[ ] Import TaskConfig from fastmcp.utilities.tasks.
[ ] Do not generate call_tool(..., task=True) in v4.
[ ] Use call_tool_task when a client needs an immediate handle.
[ ] Use Redis/Valkey for durable/scaled task execution.
[ ] Encrypt task context snapshots at rest.
[ ] Define task-enabled tools before workers start.
[ ] Use guard-style InputRequiredResult for mid-task user input.

# FastMCP Advanced — 13) Middleware and the server policy layer
### Middleware and the server policy layer

**FastMCP 4 status.** Middleware now begins at the SDK dispatch chokepoint and can observe messages that did not reach v3 middleware, including initialization/cancellation/progress notifications and requests rejected before operation handlers. Operation hooks retain one-per-operation semantics.


### 13.0 Scope and version frame

FastMCP middleware is a **FastMCP-specific** server feature, not part of the core MCP protocol. The middleware system was introduced in `2.9.0` and is explicitly framed by the docs as the place for cross-cutting behavior such as authentication, logging, rate limiting, request/response transformation, caching, and error handling without modifying individual tools, resources, or prompts. ([FastMCP][1])

The correct mental model is: middleware wraps the **server’s public MCP operations**. Requests flow inward through the middleware chain; results flow outward in reverse order. In FastMCP’s own server SDK, `call_tool`, `read_resource`, and `render_prompt` apply middleware by default, and they expose `run_middleware=False` specifically so middleware can call back into server operations without recursively reapplying the chain. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.1 Where middleware lives in the object model

Middleware is attached to the `FastMCP` server and therefore belongs to the **server policy layer**, not to individual component definitions. The server SDK exposes `add_middleware(self, middleware: Middleware) -> None`, and the middleware guide shows `mcp.add_middleware(...)` as the standard attachment API. Because server listing/execution methods already layer visibility filtering, auth filtering, and middleware execution on top of provider aggregation, middleware should be understood as the outermost request/response policy ring around the resolved component graph. ([FastMCP][3])

Minimal attachment pattern:

```python id="dpg7ym"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.logging import LoggingMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
mcp.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())
```

This attaches one middleware instance to the server’s global request pipeline; it is not scoped to just one tool or one provider. ([FastMCP][4])

### 13.2 Pipeline semantics and `call_next(context)`

FastMCP middleware is a bidirectional pipeline. The middleware guide states the flow explicitly as `Request → Middleware A → Middleware B → Handler → Middleware B → Middleware A → Response`. The controlling primitive is `call_next(context)`: calling it continues the chain; not calling it terminates processing at the current middleware. That makes middleware the correct place for pre-processing, post-processing, short-circuiting, and policy enforcement. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="dx2jws"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class SimpleLogger(Middleware):
    async def on_message(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        print(f"→ {context.method}")
        result = await call_next(context)
        print(f"← {context.method}")
        return result

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
mcp.add_middleware(SimpleLogger())
```

This is the canonical hook shape: inspect before, delegate, inspect/transform after, return the downstream result. ([FastMCP][4])

### 13.3 Execution order and stack design

Middleware executes in the order it is added. The first middleware runs first on the inbound path and last on the outbound path. The docs explicitly recommend placing error handling early so it can catch exceptions from downstream middleware and handlers, and placing logging later so it observes the post-policy execution path rather than the raw input alone. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="n9x6lf"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.error_handling import ErrorHandlingMiddleware
from fastmcp.server.middleware.rate_limiting import RateLimitingMiddleware
from fastmcp.server.middleware.logging import LoggingMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("OrderedServer")
mcp.add_middleware(ErrorHandlingMiddleware())  # 1st in, last out
mcp.add_middleware(RateLimitingMiddleware())   # 2nd in, 2nd out
mcp.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())        # 3rd in, first out
```

In practice, a robust stack often looks like: error handling near the front, then auth/rate limiting, then caching where appropriate, then logging/timing near the edge. The exact stack is policy-dependent, but the ordering rule itself is fixed by FastMCP. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.4 Mounted servers and middleware hierarchy

When servers are mounted, middleware follows a parent/child hierarchy. The middleware guide states that parent middleware runs for **all** requests, including requests routed to mounted servers, while child middleware runs only for operations handled by that mounted child. A request to a mounted child tool therefore flows through the parent’s middleware first and then the child’s middleware. ([FastMCP][2])

This matters operationally: global auth, tenancy, tracing, or rate limiting belongs naturally on the parent; child-specific logging or domain policy belongs on the mounted child. If you attach auth only to the child, parent-only requests bypass it; if you attach logging only to the parent, child-local detail may be lost unless the parent logs enough metadata. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.5 Hook hierarchy: message, request/notification, operation

FastMCP provides hook specificity levels rather than forcing everything through one universal message interceptor. The docs define three levels:

* `on_message` for all MCP traffic, both requests and notifications
* `on_request` / `on_notification` for traffic split by response expectation
* operation hooks such as `on_call_tool`, `on_read_resource`, `on_get_prompt`, `on_list_tools`, `on_list_resources`, `on_list_resource_templates`, `on_list_prompts`, and `on_initialize` for specific operations. ([FastMCP][2])

The hook order for a tool call is explicitly documented as `on_message` → `on_request` → `on_call_tool`. This gives a clean design rule: use `on_message` for full-funnel logging/metrics, `on_request` for request-wide checks like auth or rate limiting, and `on_call_tool` only when you truly need tool-specific logic. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.6 Hook signature and `MiddlewareContext`

Every hook follows the same signature pattern:

```python id="bedjlwm"
async def hook_name(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next) -> result_type:
    result = await call_next(context)
    return result
```

The middleware guide and SDK agree that `context` is the unified middleware context object and `call_next` is the async continuation function. `MiddlewareContext` exposes at least these fields: `method`, `source`, `type`, `message`, `timestamp`, and `fastmcp_context`. The SDK also exposes `copy(...)` on `MiddlewareContext` for producing modified copies when needed. ([FastMCP][2])

The most important fields in practice are:

* `context.method`: MCP method name like `"tools/call"`
* `context.message`: the operation payload object
* `context.fastmcp_context`: request-scoped FastMCP `Context`, when available. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.7 Message hooks

`on_message` runs for every MCP message, including both requests and notifications. The middleware guide recommends it for logging, metrics, and any concern that should observe the entire traffic surface. The logging middleware built-ins also anchor themselves at this level. ([FastMCP][2])

Use `on_message` when the distinction between tool/resource/prompt/listing is irrelevant and you care about the full stream of protocol events. Avoid putting operation-specific policy here unless you genuinely need a one-hook-for-everything design. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.8 Request hooks and notification hooks

`on_request` runs only for MCP requests that expect a response. The docs recommend it for authentication, authorization, and request validation. `on_notification` runs only for fire-and-forget notifications and is appropriate for event logging or asynchronous side effects. Notifications do not return values. ([FastMCP][2])

This split matters because many cross-cutting policies should apply only to request-response operations. For example, rate limiting belongs naturally on `on_request`, not on `on_message`, if you do not want server-originated notifications or other non-request traffic to count against quotas. FastMCP’s own `RateLimitingMiddleware` follows that pattern by implementing `on_request`. ([FastMCP][5])

### 13.9 Operation hooks

Operation hooks let middleware target specific MCP operations. The middleware guide documents at least:

* `on_call_tool`
* `on_read_resource`
* `on_get_prompt`
* `on_list_tools`
* `on_list_resources`
* `on_list_resource_templates`
* `on_list_prompts`
* `on_initialize`. ([FastMCP][6])

For example, `on_call_tool` receives a context whose message contains `name` and `arguments`; `on_read_resource` sees `uri`; listing hooks return FastMCP model objects like `list[Tool]`, `list[Resource]`, `list[ResourceTemplate]`, or `list[Prompt]`. This is the right hook tier for operation-specific policies such as tool-name-based auth, prompt caching, or resource URI rewriting. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.10 `on_initialize`: handshake policy and a hard timing rule

`on_initialize` runs when a client connects and initializes the session. The middleware guide is explicit that this hook **cannot modify** the initialization response. If you want to reject a client, you must raise `McpError` **before** `call_next(context)`; raising after `call_next()` only logs the error because the response has already been sent. ([FastMCP][2])

That makes `on_initialize` the correct place for early client admission control, compatibility gating, or client-info inspection, but not for post hoc response mutation. For policy that truly needs to alter later request behavior rather than the handshake itself, use later hooks plus session state. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.11 Raw handler: overriding `__call__`

If hook dispatch is too granular or too opinionated, you can bypass it by overriding `__call__` directly on a `Middleware` subclass. The docs state that this gives complete control over all messages and bypasses the hook dispatch system entirely. Use it when you want one uniform handler regardless of message type or operation. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="56y4sk"
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class RawMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def __call__(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        print(f"Processing: {context.method}")
        result = await call_next(context)
        print(f"Completed: {context.method}")
        return result
```

This is powerful but blunt. Prefer specialized hooks when possible; use raw `__call__` when the policy truly does not care about request type or operation specificity. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.12 Session availability inside middleware

`context.fastmcp_context` may exist before a full MCP session is established, but `ctx.request_context` may still be absent during phases like initialization. The middleware guide explicitly warns that session-specific attributes may be unavailable early, and recommends checking before using them. For HTTP-specific fallback data like headers or client IP during those phases, use the HTTP dependency helpers such as `get_http_headers()`. ([FastMCP][2])

This is one of the most important “gotchas” for middleware authors. Do not assume session ID, request ID, or other session-backed fields are always available in early hooks. Middleware that must run both before and after initialization should branch on session availability instead of unconditionally dereferencing session-bound data. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.13 Built-in logging middleware

FastMCP ships `LoggingMiddleware` and `StructuredLoggingMiddleware`. The middleware guide says the first produces human-readable request/response logs, while the second emits JSON-structured logs suitable for aggregation systems like Splunk or Datadog. The logging SDK describes them as comprehensive request/response logging middleware built on a common base class. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="yaojbh"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.logging import LoggingMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("LoggingDemo")
mcp.add_middleware(
    LoggingMiddleware(
        include_payloads=True,
        max_payload_length=1000,
    )
)
```

The documented configuration surface includes `include_payloads`, `max_payload_length`, and an optional custom `logger`. Use human-readable logging in development and structured JSON logging in environments where centralized log ingestion or analytics matter. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.14 Built-in timing middleware

FastMCP ships `TimingMiddleware` and `DetailedTimingMiddleware`. The middleware guide says `TimingMiddleware` logs execution duration for all requests, while the SDK says it operates on request messages rather than notifications. `DetailedTimingMiddleware` breaks timing down by operation type, including tools, resource reads, prompt retrieval, and list operations. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="0p8dwx"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.timing import TimingMiddleware, DetailedTimingMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("TimingDemo")
mcp.add_middleware(TimingMiddleware())
# or:
# mcp.add_middleware(DetailedTimingMiddleware())
```

Use `TimingMiddleware` for coarse service latency visibility. Use `DetailedTimingMiddleware` when you need per-operation performance attribution, especially on servers mixing expensive tool calls with relatively cheap list/read operations. ([FastMCP][7])

### 13.15 Response caching middleware

`ResponseCachingMiddleware` is the built-in caching layer. The middleware guide says it caches tool calls, resource reads, and list operations with TTL-based expiration; the SDK adds that it also caches `prompts/get` and all supported list methods, supports invalidation via server notifications, and can use storage backends with features like LRU eviction or size limits. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="51u4mo"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import (
    ResponseCachingMiddleware,
    CallToolSettings,
    ListToolsSettings,
    ReadResourceSettings,
)

mcp = FastMCP("CachingDemo")
mcp.add_middleware(
    ResponseCachingMiddleware(
        list_tools_settings=ListToolsSettings(ttl=30),
        call_tool_settings=CallToolSettings(included_tools=["expensive_tool"]),
        read_resource_settings=ReadResourceSettings(enabled=False),
    )
)
```

The guide lists per-operation settings classes such as `ListToolsSettings`, `ListResourcesSettings`, `ListPromptsSettings`, `CallToolSettings`, `ReadResourceSettings`, and `GetPromptSettings`. Each accepts at least `enabled`, `ttl`, and include/exclude allowlist/denylist controls for specific items. ([FastMCP][2])

For persistence or distributed deployments, the guide shows plugging in a different storage backend such as a file-tree-backed `AsyncKeyValue` store. The storage-backends docs separately state that FastMCP storage defaults to in-memory and that persistent/distributed backends are the right choice when restart durability or multi-process sharing is required. ([FastMCP][2])

The most important caveat is explicit in both the middleware guide and the SDK: **cache keys are derived from operation name and arguments only**. They do **not** include user identity or session identity. If a tool returns user-specific data derived from auth context, headers, or session state rather than explicit request arguments, you must either disable caching for that operation or make the relevant identity dimension part of the arguments. ([FastMCP][2])

A second, subtler caveat also comes from the SDK: cached results are no longer the original object instances but no-op/cache wrapper objects, so response caching may be incompatible with other middleware that expects original subclasses or exact runtime object identity. That means caching should usually sit **after** middleware that depends on original result subclasses, or those middleware should operate on normalized data rather than concrete subclass behavior. ([FastMCP][8])

### 13.16 Built-in rate limiting middleware

FastMCP provides `RateLimitingMiddleware` and `SlidingWindowRateLimitingMiddleware`. The SDK says the default rate limiter uses a **token bucket** algorithm, allowing bursts while enforcing a sustainable long-term rate, and the middleware guide documents `max_requests_per_second`, `burst_capacity`, and optional `client_id_func` as key parameters. The sliding-window variant is more precise but uses more memory to track timestamps. ([FastMCP][5])

```python id="cins8f"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.rate_limiting import (
    RateLimitingMiddleware,
    SlidingWindowRateLimitingMiddleware,
)

mcp = FastMCP("RateLimited")
mcp.add_middleware(
    RateLimitingMiddleware(
        max_requests_per_second=10.0,
        burst_capacity=20,
    )
)

# Alternative:
# mcp.add_middleware(
#     SlidingWindowRateLimitingMiddleware(max_requests=100, window_minutes=1)
# )
```

Use token-bucket rate limiting for most production servers because it handles bursty traffic well. Use sliding-window rate limiting when you need tighter fairness/precision and can afford the extra memory cost. That preference is an engineering inference from the documented algorithm tradeoffs. ([FastMCP][5])

### 13.17 Error-handling middleware

FastMCP ships `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` and `RetryMiddleware` in `fastmcp.server.middleware.error_handling`. The middleware guide says `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` centralizes error logging and transformation, while the SDK says it catches exceptions, logs them appropriately, converts them to proper MCP error responses, and tracks error patterns for monitoring through `get_error_stats()`. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="85n7bz"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.error_handling import ErrorHandlingMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("Errors")
mcp.add_middleware(
    ErrorHandlingMiddleware(
        include_traceback=True,
        transform_errors=True,
        error_callback=my_error_callback,
    )
)
```

The documented configuration surface includes `include_traceback`, `transform_errors`, and an optional `error_callback`. Place this middleware early in the stack so it can catch downstream middleware and handler exceptions. That ordering recommendation is explicit in the middleware guide. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.18 Retry middleware

`RetryMiddleware` is the built-in retry layer. The SDK says it implements automatic retry logic for transient failures with exponential backoff; the middleware guide gives `max_retries` and `retry_exceptions` as key configuration inputs. ([FastMCP][9])

```python id="1d2lyt"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.error_handling import RetryMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("Retries")
mcp.add_middleware(
    RetryMiddleware(
        max_retries=3,
        retry_exceptions=(ConnectionError, TimeoutError),
    )
)
```

Because retries replay requests, this middleware is best reserved for operations where replay is acceptable or desirable; that is an engineering recommendation inferred from the middleware’s documented behavior, not a separate FastMCP rule. In practice, it is a better fit for transient network failures or flaky upstreams than for destructive non-idempotent actions. ([FastMCP][9])

### 13.19 Ping middleware

`PingMiddleware` sends periodic server-to-client pings to keep long-lived connections alive. The middleware guide says it is most useful for **stateful HTTP connections** and has no effect on stateless connections; the SDK adds that it starts a background ping task on the first message from each session and keeps pinging until the session ends. The documented default interval is `30000` ms, configurable with `interval_ms`. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="8rcr2w"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware import PingMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("KeepAlive")
mcp.add_middleware(PingMiddleware(interval_ms=5000))
```

Use `PingMiddleware` when the deployment relies on long-lived stateful connections that may be dropped by proxies, clients, or idle timeouts. Do not expect it to help stateless request models. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.20 Custom middleware subclass patterns

FastMCP’s custom middleware story is subclass-based: derive from `Middleware`, override only the hooks you care about, and unoverridden hooks pass through automatically. The middleware guide states this directly and shows constructor-based configuration for middleware instances. ([FastMCP][2])

#### Denying requests

The guide is explicit: raise the appropriate exception type to stop processing and return an error to the client. The correct exception type depends on the operation: `ToolError` for tool calls, `ResourceError` for resource reads, `PromptError` for prompt retrieval, and `McpError` for general requests. Do **not** signal errors by returning special values or by silently skipping `call_next()`; raise. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="rd3qyo"
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext
from fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

class AuthMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        if context.message.name in {"delete_all", "admin_config"}:
            raise ToolError("Access denied: requires admin privileges")
        return await call_next(context)
```

#### Modifying requests

Request mutation is performed by altering `context.message` before delegation. The guide shows normalizing a tool argument in `context.message.arguments` before calling the next middleware/handler. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="rhooa9"
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class InputSanitizer(Middleware):
    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        if context.message.name == "search":
            query = context.message.arguments.get("query", "")
            context.message.arguments["query"] = query.strip().lower()
        return await call_next(context)
```

#### Modifying responses

Post-processing is done after `await call_next(context)`. The guide shows augmenting a tool’s `structured_content` after execution. It also notes that if the transformation is fundamentally a component-rewrite concern rather than a request/response concern, a Transform may be the better abstraction. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="n7n9gz"
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class ResponseEnricher(Middleware):
    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        result = await call_next(context)
        if context.message.name == "get_data" and result.structured_content:
            result.structured_content["processed_by"] = "enricher"
        return result
```

### 13.21 Filtering list results and maintaining execution consistency

List-operation hooks return FastMCP model objects and can be filtered before they reach the client. The middleware guide explicitly warns that if you filter list results—for example, removing private tools from `on_list_tools`—you should also block execution in the corresponding operation hook to keep the published list consistent with actual server behavior. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="0h13ck"
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext
from fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

class PrivateToolFilter(Middleware):
    async def on_list_tools(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        tools = await call_next(context)
        return [tool for tool in tools if "private" not in tool.tags]

    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        if context.fastmcp_context:
            tool = await context.fastmcp_context.fastmcp.get_tool(context.message.name)
            if "private" in tool.tags:
                raise ToolError("Tool not found")
        return await call_next(context)
```

This pattern matters for trustworthiness. If the client cannot list a tool but can still call it successfully, your published contract is incoherent. The docs explicitly recommend filtering and blocking together. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.22 Accessing component metadata inside middleware

Execution-hook contexts do not directly expose component metadata like tags. The guide says the correct pattern is to look up the component through the server using `context.fastmcp_context.fastmcp.get_tool(...)`, `get_resource(...)`, or `get_prompt(...)`. This is how middleware can implement tag-based authorization, classification, or routing decisions. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="ve8ovf"
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class TagBasedAuth(Middleware):
    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        if context.fastmcp_context:
            tool = await context.fastmcp_context.fastmcp.get_tool(context.message.name)
            if tool and "requires-auth" in tool.tags:
                # enforce auth policy here
                ...
        return await call_next(context)
```

This lookup path also respects the server’s own visibility/version rules, which is generally what you want when writing request-time policy code. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.23 Storing state in middleware for later use

The middleware guide shows middleware writing state into the FastMCP context so later tools can read it. The example uses HTTP headers, derives a `user_id`, and writes it through `context.fastmcp_context.set_state(...)`, with later tool code reading it via `ctx.get_state(...)`. This is the policy-layer way to enrich request handling without bloating public schemas. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="uj50ma"
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_http_headers

class UserMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_request(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        headers = get_http_headers() or {}
        user_id = headers.get("x-user-id", "anonymous")
        if context.fastmcp_context:
            await context.fastmcp_context.set_state("user_id", user_id)
        return await call_next(context)
```

This is appropriate for request-derived enrichment or correlation data. It is not a substitute for real authorization or for durable session-state design when data must persist beyond one request/session boundary. ([FastMCP][2])

### 13.24 Error handling inside custom middleware

The middleware guide explicitly recommends wrapping `call_next()` in `try/except` when a custom middleware needs to observe downstream failures, and then **re-raising** the exception. Catching without re-raising suppresses the error entirely. That is the correct pattern for instrumentation or auditing middleware that needs to log failures but still preserve protocol-correct error behavior. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="77r5di"
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class ErrorLogger(Middleware):
    async def on_request(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        try:
            return await call_next(context)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in {context.method}: {type(e).__name__}: {e}")
            raise
```

### 13.25 Practical policy-layer advisory

Use middleware for **cross-cutting** policy: auth, quotas, timing, caching, logging, and request/response normalization across multiple components. Use component code for component-local business logic. Use transforms when you want to change the published component graph itself rather than the live request/response flow. The middleware guide itself points to transforms for more complex tool transformations, which is the cleanest statement of the boundary. ([FastMCP][2])

The highest-risk operational mistake is unsafe caching. Because cache keys ignore user/session identity and depend only on operation name and arguments, caching any operation whose effective result depends on auth context, headers, or session state can leak data across users. That caveat is explicit in the docs and should be treated as a hard design rule, not a footnote. ([FastMCP][2])

# FastMCP Advanced — 14) Providers and dynamic component sources
### Providers and dynamic component sources

**FastMCP 4 status.** Provider architecture remains core. Use permanent v4 import homes (`fastmcp.server.providers.proxy`, `fastmcp.server.providers.openapi`); `SkillsProvider` was replaced by `SkillsDirectoryProvider` for directory aggregation.


### 14.0 Mental model: source layer vs rewrite layer vs policy layer

FastMCP v3 split server composition into two distinct layers. **Providers** are the **component source layer**: they answer “what tools/resources/prompts exist, and where do they come from?” **Transforms** are the **component-rewrite layer**: they answer “how should those components be renamed, filtered, reshaped, or bridged before clients see them?” Middleware remains the later **request/response policy layer**. If an agent confuses providers with transforms, it will tend to solve source problems with request hooks or solve publication problems with component copies. The official docs explicitly frame providers as sources and transforms as in-flight modifiers on the path from providers to clients. ([FastMCP][1])

The shortest correct pipeline is:

`Provider(s) → provider-level transforms → server-level transforms → server filtering/visibility/auth → client-visible catalog`

and, for execution, the resolved component then runs through the server’s normal middleware/auth/visibility path. Provider transforms run first; server transforms run after them and see already-transformed names. ([FastMCP][2])

### 14.1 Providers: the component source layer

Every FastMCP server has one or more providers. When a client lists tools, FastMCP asks each provider for tools and combines the results; when a client calls a specific component, FastMCP finds the provider that owns it and delegates accordingly. The docs are explicit that `@mcp.tool` adds to the server’s `LocalProvider`, so even “simple one-file servers” are already using the provider architecture whether the author notices or not. ([FastMCP][1])

Provider order is semantically significant. The provider overview states that `LocalProvider` is always first, so decorator-defined components take precedence over added providers, and additional providers are queried in the order they were added. If two providers expose the same component name, the first one wins. That makes provider order a real API-design concern rather than an implementation detail. ([FastMCP][3])

The base `Provider` contract is intentionally narrow: override protected `_list_*` methods for the component types you source; optionally override `_get_*` methods only if you can resolve a specific component more efficiently than scanning list results. The public `list_*`/`get_*` methods are already transform-aware. The custom-provider docs also state that providers return **ready-to-run component objects**; when a client calls a tool, FastMCP invokes the returned `Tool` object’s execution path, not some opaque provider callback. In other words, providers source executable components rather than “descriptions of components.” ([FastMCP][4])

Representative custom-provider skeleton:

```python id="lvn0sx"
from collections.abc import Sequence
from fastmcp.server.providers import Provider
from fastmcp.tools import Tool
from fastmcp.resources import Resource
from fastmcp.prompts import Prompt

class MyProvider(Provider):
    async def _list_tools(self) -> Sequence[Tool]:
        return []

    async def _list_resources(self) -> Sequence[Resource]:
        return []

    async def _list_prompts(self) -> Sequence[Prompt]:
        return []
```

This is the canonical provider extension point documented by FastMCP. ([FastMCP][4])

### 14.2 `LocalProvider`: code-defined components

`LocalProvider` is the default provider storing components you define directly in code through `@mcp.tool`, `@mcp.resource`, `@mcp.prompt`, or programmatic `add_*` methods. In practice, if you never compose or proxy anything, `LocalProvider` is the only provider you touch, but it is still the same provider abstraction underneath. This is why local components take precedence over mounted or proxied ones by default. ([FastMCP][1])

The engineering implication is simple: local definitions are the safest place for overrides. If you proxy or mount an upstream server and then need to replace one tool with a local variant, the local copy wins because the local provider is queried first. That precedence rule is core to safe composition. ([FastMCP][3])

### 14.3 `FastMCPProvider`: wrapping another FastMCP server

`FastMCPProvider` wraps another `FastMCP` server and exposes its components through the provider interface. The SDK page highlights the crucial behavior: wrapped components delegate execution to the child server’s middleware path, so child-server middleware still runs when the parent invokes those components. This is the correct source abstraction for **in-process server composition**. ([FastMCP][5])

FastMCP automatically uses this wrapper when you add or mount a `FastMCP` server as a provider. The aggregate-provider SDK explicitly says that if the provider is a FastMCP server, it is automatically wrapped in `FastMCPProvider` to ensure middleware is invoked correctly. That means `mount(child)` is not “copy these components into the parent”; it is “wrap the child as a live provider and preserve its execution semantics.” ([FastMCP][6])

This wrapper-based delegation is what makes mounted composition safe: child middleware, child auth, child versioning, and child execution behavior continue to exist instead of being flattened away at registration time. If you want a live child-server boundary, use `mount()`, not ad hoc import/copy patterns. ([FastMCP][5])

### 14.4 `ProxyProvider`: remote/component proxying

`ProxyProvider` is the remote-source analogue. The proxy-provider docs define it as sourcing components from another MCP server through a client connection, exposing that remote server’s tools, resources, templates, and prompts through your own server whether the backend is local or networked. The stated use cases are transport bridging, backend aggregation, controlled gateways, and stable front-door endpoints over changing backends. ([FastMCP][7])

The recommended top-level construction path is `create_proxy(...)`. The server SDK documents `create_proxy(target, **settings) -> FastMCPProxy` and says it accepts a connected or disconnected `Client`, a transport, a `FastMCP` instance, a URL, a script `Path`, or an MCP config dict. For most users, `create_proxy(...)` is the correct primitive; drop to `ProxyProvider` or `FastMCPProxy` only when you need lower-level control. ([FastMCP][8])

Minimal proxy server:

```python id="102gy0"
from fastmcp.server import create_proxy

proxy = create_proxy("http://example.com/mcp", name="MyProxy")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxy.run()
```

This is the canonical quick-start shape documented by FastMCP. ([FastMCP][7])

`ProxyProvider` returns proxy component objects—`ProxyTool`, `ProxyResource`, `ProxyTemplate`, and `ProxyPrompt`—that forward execution to the backend server. The SDK is explicit that all proxied components have `task_config.mode="forbidden"` because background tasks cannot execute through a proxy. It is also explicit that component lists are cached, with default `cache_ttl=300` seconds, shared across sessions, refreshed on `list_*` calls, and disableable via `cache_ttl=0`; disabling is recommended for dynamic backends whose catalogs change often. ([FastMCP][9])

This yields two important design rules. First, do not expect background-task semantics to survive across a generic proxy boundary; a proxy can mirror ordinary operations and advanced protocol forwarding, but proxied components are not task-capable. Second, disable proxy catalog caching when the upstream server’s component list changes dynamically, otherwise name/metadata staleness will be your default behavior. ([FastMCP][9])

### 14.5 Proxy session models: isolated vs shared

`create_proxy()` defaults to **session isolation**: each request gets its own isolated backend session. The proxy docs call this the recommended mode and explicitly say it prevents context mixing when multiple clients use the proxy concurrently. ([FastMCP][7])

If you instead pass an already-connected client to `create_proxy(...)`, the proxy reuses that session. The docs warn that all requests then share one backend session, which may cause context mixing under concurrency; this should be reserved for single-threaded or explicitly synchronized situations. ([FastMCP][7])

This is a major deployment advisory: default to isolated sessions unless you have a backend that is intentionally stateful and you fully control concurrency. Shared-session proxying is an optimization/special case, not the safe default. ([FastMCP][7])

### 14.6 Proxy feature forwarding

FastMCP’s proxy layer is not limited to tools/resources/prompts. The proxy-provider SDK documents default forwarding handlers for roots, sampling, elicitation, logging, and progress, and the `ProxyClient` class is described as forwarding these advanced interactions between the remote server and the proxy’s connected clients. This is why FastMCP proxying is more than just “HTTP fetch and replay”; it forwards the richer MCP feature surface as well. ([FastMCP][9])

For agent authors, the consequence is positive but bounded: proxying preserves a surprising amount of MCP richness, but it still does not make proxied components locally task-capable and it still inherits the operational caveats of remote latency, caching, and session strategy. ([FastMCP][9])

### 14.7 `FileSystemProvider`: filesystem discovery / hot-reload source

`FileSystemProvider` is the convention-over-coordination provider. The docs say it scans a directory for Python files, imports them, and registers any standalone-decorated `Tool`, `Resource`, `ResourceTemplate`, or `Prompt` objects it finds. The key architectural point is that files use standalone decorators (`@tool`, `@resource`, `@prompt`) and do not need access to a server instance. ([FastMCP][10])

```python id="jlwmga"
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.providers import FileSystemProvider

mcp = FastMCP(
    "MyServer",
    providers=[FileSystemProvider(Path(__file__).parent / "mcp")]
)
```

This is the documented quick-start pattern. ([FastMCP][11])

The SDK surface for `FileSystemProvider` is small but important: `root` controls the directory to scan, and `reload=True` rescans on every request. The docs present reload mode as a development-time convenience and the default `reload=False` as scan-once-at-init caching behavior. Use reload only when you are actively editing discovered files; leave it off in production to avoid repeated import/discovery overhead. ([FastMCP][10])

One additional nuance: the filesystem provider supports the normal standalone decorator option surfaces. The docs explicitly say the standalone `@tool` decorator used in discovered files still supports the standard tool options such as `name`, `title`, `description`, `icons`, `tags`, `output_schema`, `annotations`, and `meta`. That means filesystem discovery is not a “reduced capability mode”; it is merely a different source layer. ([FastMCP][12])

### 14.8 Skills providers: exposing skills as MCP resources

Skills providers are specialized providers that expose agent-skill directories as MCP resources. The skills docs define a skill as a directory centered on `SKILL.md` plus optional supporting files, and say the provider exposes those skills as discoverable/readable `skill://...` resources. This is a resource-first abstraction, not a tool abstraction. ([FastMCP][13])

The core provider forms are:

* `SkillProvider` for one skill directory
* `SkillsDirectoryProvider` for one or more roots containing many skills
* vendor-specific providers such as `ClaudeSkillsProvider`, `CursorSkillsProvider`, `VSCodeSkillsProvider`, `CodexSkillsProvider`, `GeminiSkillsProvider`, `GooseSkillsProvider`, `CopilotSkillsProvider`, and `OpenCodeSkillsProvider`, which preconfigure platform-default roots. ([FastMCP][13])

```python id="okuq1q"
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.providers.skills import SkillsDirectoryProvider

mcp = FastMCP("Skills Server")
mcp.add_provider(
    SkillsDirectoryProvider(roots=Path.home() / ".claude" / "skills")
)
```

This is the documented general pattern. ([FastMCP][13])

The resource model is explicit: each skill exposes a main file resource like `skill://pdf-processing/SKILL.md`, a synthetic manifest `skill://pdf-processing/_manifest`, and optionally supporting-file resources. `SkillsDirectoryProvider` can scan multiple roots, and the docs say the first root takes precedence if the same skill name appears in multiple locations. ([FastMCP][13])

A particularly important configuration knob is `supporting_files=`. With `supporting_files="template"`—the default—supporting files are hidden from `list_resources()` and exposed through a `ResourceTemplate`, keeping the catalog compact while allowing manifest-driven discovery. With `supporting_files="resources"`, every supporting file appears as an individual resource in `list_resources()`. Use template mode when you want smaller catalogs; use resources mode when clients need flat, fully enumerable file visibility. The same page also documents `reload=True` for re-scanning on every request, again positioning it as a development convenience rather than a production default. ([FastMCP][13])

### 14.9 Custom providers: when to build one

The custom-provider docs say you build a custom provider when components come from somewhere other than code-defined decorators, child FastMCP servers, or remote proxies: databases, external APIs, configuration systems, multi-tenant catalogs, or plugin systems. The provider abstraction is the correct place to source those components. ([FastMCP][4])

The same docs also draw an important architectural boundary: it is often cleaner to let a provider source **all possible components**, then use middleware or visibility controls to filter what each request can actually see. In other words, source selection and request-specific publication are different concerns. Do not try to encode every per-request policy into the provider itself if visibility/middleware can do it later more cleanly. ([FastMCP][4])

Custom providers also get lifecycle management via `lifespan()`. The docs show providers using `lifespan()` to open DB/API connections at server startup and close them at shutdown, with FastMCP calling the provider lifespan automatically. This is the correct place for provider-owned connection pools or clients. ([FastMCP][4])

### 14.10 Transforms: the component-rewrite layer

Transforms modify components **as they flow** from providers to clients. The transforms overview describes them as pipeline filters; when listing, transforms are pure sequence-to-sequence functions, and when resolving a specific component by name/URI they behave like middleware, mapping the client-facing name back to the original before returning the transformed result. This dual list/get behavior is the key conceptual model. ([FastMCP][2])

Built-in transforms currently include `Namespace`, `ToolTransform`, `Enabled`, `Tool Search`, `ResourcesAsTools`, `PromptsAsTools`, and experimental `Code Mode`. Of those, the highest-value composition transforms for most servers are `Namespace`, `ToolTransform`, `ToolSearch`, `ResourcesAsTools`, and `PromptsAsTools`. ([FastMCP][2])

### 14.11 Provider-level vs server-level transforms

Transforms can be attached either to a provider or to the server. Provider-level transforms affect one source and run first; server-level transforms affect the aggregated component graph and run after provider transforms. The transforms overview makes this ordering explicit and shows that server-level transforms see already-transformed names. ([FastMCP][2])

This yields a strong authoring rule:

* use **provider-level transforms** for source-local rewrites, such as namespacing or schema cleanup of one mounted/proxied source;
* use **server-level transforms** for global publication policy, such as version-prefixing or whole-server search replacement. ([FastMCP][2])

Transforms stack in the order added; the first added is innermost, and later transforms wrap it. The overview explicitly demonstrates `verbose_name -> api_verbose_name -> short` as the flow when `Namespace` is added first and a later `ToolTransform` renames the namespaced tool. This ordering matters when composing namespace + rewrite + visibility transforms. ([FastMCP][2])

### 14.12 `add_transform(...)` vs `wrap_transform(...)`

On providers, `add_transform(...)` mutates the provider in place, while `wrap_transform(...)` returns a new provider wrapper with the transform applied and leaves the original unchanged. The provider-base SDK explicitly recommends `wrap_transform(...)` when the same provider will be reused in multiple aggregators with different transform stacks, such as different namespaces. ([FastMCP][14])

Use `add_transform(...)` when the provider instance is single-owner and mutable by design. Use `wrap_transform(...)` when the provider is a reusable building block and you want composition without side effects. This is one of the most important ergonomics rules in the whole provider system. ([FastMCP][14])

### 14.13 `Namespace` — conflict prevention by systematic prefixing

`Namespace("api")` prefixes all component names from a source. The namespace docs say tools and prompts get underscore-separated prefixes, while resources and templates get URI path-segment prefixes. The canonical examples are:

* tool `my_tool` → `api_my_tool`
* prompt `my_prompt` → `api_my_prompt`
* resource `data://info` → `data://api/info`
* template `data://{id}` → `data://api/{id}`. ([FastMCP][15])

This is the default safety transform for composition and the most common transform used by `mount(..., namespace="...")`. In a multi-server parent, namespacing should be treated as the default unless you are intentionally constructing one flat shared namespace and fully control collisions. ([FastMCP][15])

### 14.14 `ToolTransform` — schema and interface rewriting

`ToolTransform` is the deferred tool-schema rewrite mechanism. The transform page says it is used when tools flow through a transform chain—especially tools from mounted servers, proxies, or other providers you do not control directly—and that it can rename tools, change descriptions, adjust tags, and reshape argument schemas. ([FastMCP][16])

Representative transform:

```python id="uxlpz6"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.transforms import ToolTransform
from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import ToolTransformConfig

mcp = FastMCP("TransformDemo")

@mcp.tool
def verbose_internal_data_fetcher(query: str) -> str:
    return f"Results for: {query}"

mcp.add_transform(ToolTransform({
    "verbose_internal_data_fetcher": ToolTransformConfig(
        name="search",
        description="Search the database.",
    )
}))
```

Clients now see `search` instead of the original tool name. That exact pattern is documented. ([FastMCP][16])

The lower-level tool-transform SDK exposes the argument-rewrite vocabulary through `ArgTransform`. Supported per-argument rewrites include renaming, description changes, default/default_factory insertion, type changes, hiding an argument, forcing requiredness, and adding examples. `TransformedTool.from_tool(...)` additionally supports overriding tool name, version, title, description, tags, annotations, output schema, and meta, with helper functions `forward()` and `forward_raw()` for custom forwarding logic. This is the deeper API behind `ToolTransform` and the right place to look when schema surgery must become exact. ([FastMCP][17])

One useful distinction from the transform docs: `ToolTransform` is the **deferred** rewrite mechanism; `Tool.from_tool()` / `TransformedTool.from_tool()` are the **immediate** object-level rewrite mechanism. Use deferred transforms when you do not control the source or want composition-time rewrites; use immediate object transforms when you already have the tool object and want to register a rewritten copy. ([FastMCP][16])

### 14.15 `ToolSearch` — discovery compression for large catalogs

`ToolSearch` is the transform family for replacing full tool listings with on-demand discovery. The docs state that when a search transform is installed, `list_tools()` returns only two synthetic tools:

* `search_tools`
* `call_tool`

while the original tools remain fully callable but hidden from listing. Search covers tool names, descriptions, parameter names, and parameter descriptions, and search results come back in the same JSON format as `list_tools`, including full input schema. ([FastMCP][18])

FastMCP currently documents two search strategies:

* `RegexSearchTransform`, which uses case-insensitive regex matching, has zero indexing overhead, and is the best fit when the model can formulate targeted patterns;
* `BM25SearchTransform`, which uses BM25 ranking, builds an in-memory index lazily, rebuilds it when tool text changes, and is better for natural-language discovery queries. ([FastMCP][18])

By default, search returns up to 5 tools. Both transforms support `max_results`; they also support `always_visible` to pin specific tools into the listing alongside the synthetic search tools, and configurable synthetic tool names if `search_tools` / `call_tool` would collide with real tool names. The docs also state that the `call_tool` proxy resolves the target through the server’s **normal** tool pipeline, including transforms and middleware, and explicitly rejects recursive calls to the synthetic tools themselves. ([FastMCP][18])

Use ToolSearch when catalog size is large enough that dumping all tools into LLM context harms cost or selection quality. This is one of the clearest examples of transforms as “client-catalog UX rewrites” rather than source rewrites. ([FastMCP][18])

### 14.16 `ResourcesAsTools` — bridge resources to tool-only clients

Some MCP clients cannot speak the resource protocol at all. `ResourcesAsTools` solves that by generating two synthetic tools, `list_resources` and `read_resource`, which route through the server at runtime so normal middleware, auth, visibility, and rate limiting still apply. The docs explicitly say the transform should be applied to a **FastMCP server instance**, not to a raw Provider, because the generated tools need a server to route back through. If you want only a subset of resources exposed this way, create a dedicated subserver for those resources and apply the transform there. ([FastMCP][19])

```python id="4k9cap"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.transforms import ResourcesAsTools

mcp = FastMCP("ResourceBridge")

@mcp.resource("config://app")
def app_config() -> str:
    return '{"app_name": "My App", "version": "1.0.0"}'

mcp.add_transform(ResourcesAsTools(mcp))
```

The generated `list_resources` output distinguishes static resources (`uri`) from templates (`uri_template`), and `read_resource` accepts a concrete URI, including filled-in template URIs. The docs also note that binary content read through `read_resource` is base64-encoded in the tool response. Both generated tools are marked `readOnlyHint=True`. ([FastMCP][19])

### 14.17 `PromptsAsTools` — bridge prompts to tool-only clients

`PromptsAsTools` is the prompt analogue. It generates `list_prompts` and `get_prompt` tools, again routing through the server’s normal middleware chain, and again should be applied to a FastMCP server rather than a raw Provider. If only a subset of prompts should be exposed this way, the docs explicitly recommend building a dedicated subserver for that subset and applying the transform there. ([FastMCP][20])

```python id="c8i5v9"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.transforms import PromptsAsTools

mcp = FastMCP("PromptBridge")

@mcp.prompt
def analyze_code(code: str, language: str = "python") -> str:
    return f"Analyze this {language} code:\n{code}"

mcp.add_transform(PromptsAsTools(mcp))
```

`list_prompts` returns prompt metadata plus arguments, while `get_prompt` takes a prompt name and optional arguments dict and returns standard MCP-format messages. This transform is valuable whenever the client can only call tools but your server’s “real” high-level reusable assets are prompts. ([FastMCP][20])

### 14.18 `mount(...)` — safe in-process composition

`mount(...)` is the primary server-composition primitive for bringing another `FastMCP` server under a parent. The composition docs frame it as a **live link**, not a snapshot: if you add components to the child after mounting, they become immediately available through the parent. This is the right primitive for modular monorepos, feature servers, and in-process orchestration layers. ([FastMCP][21])

```python id="x6c8fx"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

weather = FastMCP("Weather")
calendar = FastMCP("Calendar")

@weather.tool
def get_data() -> str:
    return "Weather data"

@calendar.tool
def get_data() -> str:
    return "Calendar data"

main = FastMCP("Main")
main.mount(weather, namespace="weather")
main.mount(calendar, namespace="calendar")
```

This is the documented namespacing pattern for conflict-safe composition. ([FastMCP][21])

One underused but important detail from the transforms overview: the provider returned by `mount()` can itself receive provider-level transforms. That means you can namespace at mount time and then add a further `ToolTransform` to only that mounted source without touching the child server or the parent’s whole catalog. ([FastMCP][2])

### 14.19 `create_proxy(...)` and mounting external servers

The composition docs show `mount(create_proxy(...), namespace="...")` as the canonical pattern for combining remote or subprocess-backed servers under one parent. `create_proxy()` accepts URLs directly, local Python script paths, MCP config dicts (including npm/uvx command specs), and explicit transport objects. This makes it the “bring something external under the provider graph” primitive. ([FastMCP][21])

Representative external composition:

```python id="7via7x"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server import create_proxy

mcp = FastMCP("Orchestrator")

mcp.mount(create_proxy("http://api.example.com/mcp"), namespace="api")
mcp.mount(create_proxy("./my_server.py"), namespace="local")

github_config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "default": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
        }
    }
}
mcp.mount(create_proxy(github_config), namespace="github")
```

This exact set of patterns—remote HTTP, local script, npm config—is documented. ([FastMCP][21])

### 14.20 Conflict resolution and precedence in composition

Conflict resolution differs slightly depending on the layer you are looking at. Provider order says `LocalProvider` wins over later-added providers. Within mounted-server composition specifically, the composition docs state that when multiple mounted servers share the same namespace (or no namespace), the **most recently mounted server** takes precedence for conflicting component names. That is a mount-layer override rule on top of the broader provider-order model. ([FastMCP][3])

The safe operational default is therefore:

* local overrides first;
* namespaced mounts to avoid accidental collision;
* if you intentionally share a namespace, assume latest mount wins and document it. ([FastMCP][3])

### 14.21 Recursive tag filtering and parent policy

The composition docs explicitly state that parent-server tag filters apply recursively to mounted servers. This means a parent can mount a large child and then publish only a filtered slice of it through tag-based visibility. Example patterns in the docs show mounting and then calling `enable(tags={"production"}, only=True)` on the parent so only namespaced production-tagged child components are exposed. ([FastMCP][21])

This is a powerful separation-of-concerns pattern: children publish full catalogs; the parent decides what slice of those catalogs is actually visible in a given orchestration or deployment context. It reinforces the earlier rule that providers source components while transforms/visibility policies decide publication. ([FastMCP][4])

### 14.22 Performance characteristics of composition

The composition docs explicitly warn that parent operations like `list_tools()` inherit the latency of all mounted sources. They call out three particularly expensive cases: HTTP-based mounted servers (hundreds of milliseconds instead of local-microseconds/milliseconds), mounted servers with slow initialization, and deep mounting hierarchies. The docs recommend caching strategies or shallower hierarchies when low latency is critical. ([FastMCP][21])

That performance note should heavily influence design: use mount/proxy composition for correctness, modularity, and operational safety—but do not assume the parent catalog is “free” once multiple remote or deep child sources are involved. Search transforms, cache layers, and explicit namespace partitioning become much more valuable in those topologies. ([FastMCP][21])

### 14.23 Provider vs middleware: the boundary

The custom-provider docs make this boundary unusually explicit: it is often cleaner to let a provider source all possible components and then use middleware or visibility controls to decide what a particular request can see. That is the crisp separation:

* provider = source all potential components
* transform/visibility = rewrite/filter the published catalog
* middleware = enforce per-request behavioral policy at execution time. ([FastMCP][4])

If an agent tries to express per-request auth policy in a provider, or source-discovery logic in middleware, the design usually becomes harder to reason about. FastMCP’s architecture is specifically trying to prevent that tangle. ([FastMCP][4])

### 14.24 Composition advisories for agent authors

Use `LocalProvider` for code-defined components, `mount(child_server)` for in-process modular composition, `create_proxy(...)` / `ProxyProvider` for remote or subprocess backends, `FileSystemProvider` when you want file-system discovery without server/file coupling, `SkillsDirectoryProvider` when the thing you are publishing is fundamentally a skill/resource corpus, and a custom `Provider` when the source is a database, API, config registry, or tenant-aware dynamic catalog. That mapping is the cleanest “which source layer should I pick?” heuristic supported by the docs. ([FastMCP][1])

Default to **namespaces** whenever you compose more than one nontrivial provider or child server. Use `ToolTransform` to improve ergonomics or schema clarity of mounted/proxied components instead of copying them locally. Use `wrap_transform()` instead of mutating shared provider instances when the same source will be mounted into multiple parents. ([FastMCP][15])

Use `ResourcesAsTools` and `PromptsAsTools` only on an actual server instance and preferably on a dedicated subserver when you need subset exposure. Do not apply them blindly at the top of a large server unless you actually need tool-only bridging for the entire resource/prompt catalog. The docs explicitly recommend dedicated subservers when only subsets should be exposed. ([FastMCP][19])

For remote composition, prefer `create_proxy()` over lower-level proxy classes unless you specifically need custom session factories or advanced proxy-provider control. Leave proxy session isolation enabled unless you fully understand the concurrency consequences of shared-session reuse. Disable proxy component-list caching when the upstream component catalog changes dynamically. ([FastMCP][8])

If you want the next section, the natural continuation is **13) Authentication and authorization**, because providers/transforms determine what exists and how it is published, while auth determines who can see or execute any of it.

# FastMCP Advanced — 15) Transforms, visibility, versioning, pagination, and discovery shaping


**FastMCP 4 status.** Transforms/visibility/versioning remain core. Treat model fields in resolved MCP objects as snake_case and test publication across both protocol eras when behavior depends on era capabilities.

## 15.0 Publication-pipeline mental model

Providers answer **what components exist**. Transforms answer **what the published component graph should look like**. Final FastMCP filtering then decides what the current client/session is allowed to see.

```text
source Provider
   -> provider transforms
   -> aggregate providers
   -> server transforms
   -> enabled/disabled + authorization + session visibility
   -> pagination
   -> MCP list response
```

Transforms are therefore part of the public API contract. A rename, namespace, hidden argument, search transform, or visibility rule can change what a client sees without modifying the underlying Python function. ([Transforms][1])

---

## 15.1 Provider-level vs server-level transforms

Provider-local transform:

```python
provider = provider.wrap_transform(Namespace("billing"))
```

Server-level transform:

```python
mcp = FastMCP(
    "Gateway",
    providers=[provider],
    transforms=[global_transform],
)
```

Rules:

* provider transforms affect one source and run before aggregation;
* server transforms affect the combined server view and run later;
* later transforms see the output of earlier transforms;
* place a rule at the narrowest level that matches its intended scope. ([Transforms][1])

---

## 15.2 Namespace transform

Namespacing is the preferred collision-avoidance mechanism when composing component sources.

```python
from fastmcp.server.transforms import Namespace

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Gateway",
    providers=[
        crm_provider.wrap_transform(Namespace("crm")),
        billing_provider.wrap_transform(Namespace("billing")),
    ],
)
```

Conceptually:

```text
get_customer       -> crm_get_customer
create_invoice     -> billing_create_invoice
```

Resources/templates are namespaced according to their URI semantics rather than merely string-prefixing a tool name. ([Namespace][2])

---

## 15.3 `mount(..., namespace=...)`

For mounted FastMCP servers, use the mount API rather than manually cloning components:

```python
root = FastMCP("Root")
root.mount(crm, namespace="crm")
root.mount(billing, namespace="billing")
```

`mount()` constructs live provider composition; changes in the child server remain dynamically visible through the parent. Namespace transforms make collisions explicit. ([Composition][3])

---

## 15.4 Tool transformation

Tool transformations let you adapt a tool for LLM use without rewriting its implementation:

```text
original tool
  -> rename tool
  -> rename/hide arguments
  -> rewrite descriptions
  -> change schema presentation
  -> published transformed tool
```

Use cases:

* normalize a third-party API tool name;
* replace implementation-oriented parameter names with model-friendly names;
* hide infrastructure parameters;
* narrow descriptions;
* adapt an OpenAPI-generated tool into a curated contract.

Prefer transformation when the underlying callable remains a valid reusable implementation and only the MCP-facing interface needs to change. ([Tool Transformation][4])

---

## 15.5 Transform vs wrapper tool

Choose a transform when:

```text
behavior stays the same
input/output semantics stay fundamentally the same
only publication shape changes
```

Choose a wrapper tool when:

```text
behavior changes
multiple backend operations are composed
a policy decision must run in business logic
input/output semantics are intentionally redesigned
```

A transform is not a substitute for domain orchestration.

---

## 15.6 Resources-as-tools bridge

Some MCP hosts primarily expose tool calling. `ResourcesAsTools` bridges the resource surface into synthetic tools for listing and reading resources.

Conceptual result:

```text
resource protocol surface
   -> list_resources tool
   -> read_resource tool
```

Use only when client compatibility requires it; do not turn every resource into a bespoke imperative tool by hand. ([Resources as Tools][5])

---

## 15.7 Prompts-as-tools bridge

`PromptsAsTools` similarly adapts prompt listing/rendering for tool-only clients.

Use it when the consuming host lacks native prompt operations but the prompt catalog should remain authored as prompts on the server. This preserves the semantic source model while adapting the published interface. ([Prompts as Tools][6])

---

## 15.8 Visibility model

FastMCP v3 uses visibility transforms rather than per-component mutable `enabled` flags as the primary publication-control mechanism.

Examples:

```python
mcp.disable(tags={"internal"})
mcp.enable(tags={"public"}, only=True)
mcp.disable(keys={"tool:dangerous_delete@"})
```

Visibility can target dimensions such as:

* component keys;
* names/URIs;
* tags;
* versions/version specs;
* component type/kind;
* match-all criteria.

Later visibility rules can override earlier ones. ([Visibility][7])

---

## 15.9 Component keys

FastMCP component identity includes component kind, identifier, and version. Conceptual examples:

```text
tool:get_customer@
tool:get_customer@2.0
prompt:review@
resource:config://app@
```

Use component keys when exact identity matters—fingerprinting, targeted visibility, audits, or version-specific policy. Names alone may be ambiguous once multiple versions exist. ([Versioning][8])

---

## 15.10 Allowlist mode with `only=True`

A strong publication posture is to start with an allowlist:

```python
mcp.enable(tags={"public"}, only=True)
```

Then selectively add or subtract:

```python
mcp.enable(tags={"beta"})
mcp.disable(names={"delete_account"})
```

This is safer for large/generated provider catalogs than registering hundreds of operations and trying to remember every one that should be hidden.

---

## 15.11 Session-scoped visibility in FastMCP 3

Within a request/session, `Context` can change the component view for that session:

```python
@mcp.tool
async def enter_admin_mode(ctx: Context) -> str:
    await ctx.enable_components(tags={"admin"})
    return "Admin components enabled for this session"
```

Related operations include disabling and resetting session visibility. This lets one server expose different catalogs based on workflow/client state without globally mutating the server. ([Context][9])

**Security rule:** visibility is not automatically authorization. Sensitive components should still enforce authorization even if normally hidden.

---

## 15.12 Versioned components

Register multiple implementations under the same public name:

```python
@mcp.tool(name="search", version="1.0")
def search_v1(query: str) -> list[str]:
    ...


@mcp.tool(name="search", version="2.0")
def search_v2(query: str, limit: int = 20) -> list[dict]:
    ...
```

When no version is requested explicitly, FastMCP selects the highest enabled version according to its version comparison rules. ([Versioning][8])

---

## 15.13 Version ordering

FastMCP attempts semantic/PEP-440-style comparison where possible and falls back for nonstandard strings. Prefer predictable version identifiers:

```text
1.0
1.1
2.0
2.1rc1
```

Avoid arbitrary labels whose lexical ordering surprises you:

```text
new
newer
final2
2026-special
```

If date versions are used, use a sortable canonical format such as `2026.08.19` only after verifying your exact version-comparison semantics.

---

## 15.14 Highest-version fallback and visibility

A key v3 behavior is that the highest version can be disabled while a lower enabled version remains available.

Conceptual:

```text
search@2.0 -> disabled for this client
search@1.0 -> enabled
get_tool("search") -> returns highest enabled version
```

This makes versioning useful for staged rollout/rollback without renaming public capabilities.

---

## 15.15 Versioning is not database migration

Component versions solve **MCP contract selection**. They do not solve:

* persistent state migration;
* DB schema migration;
* backward-compatible side effects;
* data-format conversion;
* cross-service API coordination.

Treat component version as one layer of a broader compatibility strategy.

---

## 15.16 Pagination

FastMCP v3 supports pagination for potentially large component lists. Configure the server page size:

```python
mcp = FastMCP(
    "Registry",
    list_page_size=50,
)
```

Pagination applies to protocol listing surfaces such as tools/resources/prompts where relevant. `None` means unpaginated. FastMCP requires positive page sizes. ([Pagination][10])

---

## 15.17 Why pagination matters even with Tool Search

Pagination and tool search solve different problems:

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| protocol response too large | pagination |
| model should not receive full catalog | search transform / Code Mode |
| client needs all items eventually | paginate through pages |
| tool selection degrades with hundreds of tools | search transform |

Do not assume pagination alone fixes LLM context overload—the client may still collect every page and inject every tool into model context.

---

## 15.18 Search transforms as discovery shaping

Tool Search replaces a broad visible catalog with a small synthetic discovery interface while preserving the underlying tools as callable. FastMCP 3.1 made this a major capability. Detailed search/Code Mode behavior is in §16. ([Tool Search][11])

---

## 15.19 Transform order is API behavior

Bad mental model:

```text
"all transforms are independent decorations"
```

Correct mental model:

```text
Transform A changes a component
Transform B receives A's output
Transform C receives B's output
```

Example consequence:

```text
Namespace first -> later name filter must match namespaced names
Filter first    -> namespace sees only surviving components
```

Document transform order in production systems; do not rely on a future maintainer guessing it from a long constructor argument list.

---

## 15.20 Provider reuse and immutable wrapping

When the same provider will be mounted in multiple places with different transforms:

```python
public = base_provider.wrap_transform(public_transform)
admin = base_provider.wrap_transform(admin_transform)
```

Prefer immutable wrapping over mutating the shared provider with `add_transform` unless the provider instance is intentionally single-owner. This avoids transform leakage between servers. ([Providers][12])

---

## 15.21 Large generated provider pattern

For OpenAPI or dynamic registries:

```text
OpenAPIProvider / custom Provider
  -> source-specific ToolTransform (rename/clean descriptions)
  -> visibility allowlist
  -> Namespace if aggregated
  -> Tool Search / Code Mode if catalog is large
  -> server auth/authorization
```

This is preferable to exposing the raw generated endpoint catalog unchanged.

---

## 15.22 Publication policy vs runtime authorization

Use transforms/visibility for:

```text
what the model/client should normally see
```

Use authorization for:

```text
what the authenticated caller may execute/read/render
```

A hidden tool may still be callable by exact name depending on transform semantics; a secure tool must enforce access at resolution/execution time. See §17–18.

---

## 15.23 Version-aware rollout example

```python
@mcp.tool(name="summarize", version="1.0", tags={"stable"})
def summarize_v1(text: str) -> str:
    ...


@mcp.tool(name="summarize", version="2.0", tags={"beta"})
def summarize_v2(text: str, style: str = "concise") -> dict:
    ...

# default server posture
mcp.enable(tags={"stable"}, only=True)
```

A controlled session/user group can then enable `beta` components through an authorization-aware workflow. Avoid enabling beta merely from an untrusted client-supplied flag.

---

## 15.24 Contract-regression implication

A tool's Python function may be unchanged while its published MCP contract changes because of:

* transform configuration;
* namespace order;
* visibility rules;
* version selection;
* schema dereferencing policy;
* OpenAPI provider changes.

Therefore snapshot/fingerprint the **resolved client-visible tool**, not only the source function signature. See §30.

---

## 15.25 Anti-pattern inventory

* relying on provider registration order to resolve name collisions instead of namespaces;
* globally mutating a provider reused by several servers;
* treating hidden as authorized;
* exposing thousands of generated tools because pagination technically works;
* using `enabled=` on components as the main v3 control rather than visibility rules;
* mixing semantic tool versions with arbitrary deployment build IDs;
* assuming version strings always sort lexically;
* filtering before/after namespace transforms without documenting which names the filter sees;
* allowing a session to enable privileged components without authorization checks;
* hand-copying transformed tools into a second local registry;
* snapshotting source schemas but not resolved/transformed schemas.

---

## 15.26 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Place transforms at provider or server scope deliberately.
[ ] Namespace independent providers before collisions happen.
[ ] Use transforms for publication shape; wrappers for behavioral changes.
[ ] Use visibility for discoverability/exposure, not as the sole auth boundary.
[ ] Use component keys for exact identity.
[ ] Use stable version strings and test highest-version selection.
[ ] Configure pagination for large catalogs.
[ ] Add Tool Search/Code Mode when model context would otherwise contain a huge catalog.
[ ] Use wrap_transform() for providers reused in multiple aggregators.
[ ] Snapshot/fingerprint final client-visible schemas after transforms.

# FastMCP Advanced — 16) Search transforms, Code Mode, composition, proxying, and gateways


**FastMCP 4 status.** Search/Code Mode/composition/proxying remain important. Proxies mirror the frontend protocol era on backend connections; `ClientGroup` is a distinct alternative when each backend should retain an independent connection and protocol era (see §43).

## 16.0 Why this is a separate architecture topic

FastMCP 3.1 introduced discovery transforms aimed at a problem that ordinary MCP listing does not solve well: a server may legitimately own hundreds or thousands of tools, but sending every schema to an LLM wastes context and often makes selection worse. FastMCP's search and Code Mode surfaces treat tool discovery as an explicit runtime operation rather than an unconditional prompt payload. ([Tool Search][1]) ([FastMCP Updates][2])

At the same time, v3 providers make it easy to aggregate multiple servers, which increases catalog size further. The scalable pattern is therefore:

```text
many providers / mounted servers / proxies
    -> namespacing + curation
    -> search or Code Mode
    -> small model-visible discovery interface
```

---

## 16.1 Regex search transform

FastMCP's tool-search surface includes a zero-index-overhead regex strategy:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.transforms.search import RegexSearchTransform

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Registry",
    transforms=[RegexSearchTransform()],
)
```

Instead of exposing the entire catalog in `list_tools`, the transform publishes synthetic discovery/execution tools. The underlying tools remain callable; search changes discovery, not the existence of the original tool. ([Tool Search][1])

Use regex search when tool names/descriptions are already descriptive and the model can formulate useful lexical patterns.

---

## 16.2 Search-result contract

A search transform should give the model enough information to decide and invoke without forcing the full registry into context.

Conceptually:

```text
search_tools(pattern="invoice|billing")
    -> selected tool definitions + input schemas

call_tool(name="billing_create_invoice", arguments={...})
    -> execute underlying tool
```

The exact synthetic tool names/parameters are part of the transform contract; snapshot them if your agent prompt depends on them.

---

## 16.3 Search is discoverability, not security

A tool hidden from `list_tools` by search can still be directly callable by exact identity depending on the transform. Therefore:

```text
Search transform -> limits model-visible discovery surface
Authorization    -> limits what caller may actually execute
```

Never rely on "the model cannot see it" as the security control for destructive or privileged tools.

---

## 16.4 Code Mode — stable 3.1 feature, experimental transform

FastMCP 3.1's Code Mode lets the model discover tools and write Python orchestration that calls them inside a sandbox. Install the optional extra:

```bash
uv add "fastmcp[code-mode]==4.0.0"
```

Configure:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.experimental.transforms.code_mode import CodeMode

mcp = FastMCP(
    "CodeModeServer",
    transforms=[CodeMode()],
)
```

The transform is explicitly described as experimental even though the overall interface is usable in v3. Treat discovery tool details as more volatile than core `@mcp.tool` APIs. ([Code Mode][3])

---

## 16.5 Default Code Mode workflow

The documented mental model is a three-stage interaction:

```text
1. search
   -> identify likely tools

2. get_schema
   -> retrieve parameter details only for selected tools

3. execute
   -> run sandboxed Python that calls tools and returns final value
```

Inside the sandbox, the model uses a controlled `call_tool(name, params)` primitive rather than arbitrary direct access to your application objects. This reduces both up-front schema tokens and intermediate LLM round-trips for multi-tool workflows. ([Code Mode][3])

---

## 16.6 Code Mode value case

Without Code Mode:

```text
LLM -> tool A -> result A -> LLM -> tool B -> result B -> LLM -> tool C
```

Every intermediate result passes through model context.

With Code Mode:

```text
LLM -> execute(code chaining A/B/C) -> final result
```

Intermediate values can remain inside the sandboxed program. This is especially valuable when tools return large objects that are only inputs to the next operation.

---

## 16.7 Code Mode is not arbitrary code execution permission

Treat the sandbox as a security boundary:

* restrict available globals/imports according to the implementation;
* expose capability-bearing operations only through approved tool calls;
* bound runtime, memory, output size, and loops;
* treat tool authorization as still mandatory;
* do not assume sandboxing protects against every downstream tool side effect;
* review Code Mode dependency/runtime changes on upgrade.

The strongest security model is still "the model may only cause side effects through explicitly authorized tools."

---

## 16.8 Discovery detail tradeoff

FastMCP Code Mode supports progressive tool detail. Conceptually:

| Detail | Model receives | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| brief | tool name + short description | low |
| detailed | parameters/types/required markers | medium |
| full | full JSON Schema | high |

Use the least detail sufficient to write a correct call. Large nested schemas can dominate context if every search result returns full detail.

---

## 16.9 Compose focused child servers

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

crm = FastMCP("CRM")
billing = FastMCP("Billing")
analytics = FastMCP("Analytics")

root = FastMCP("EnterpriseGateway")
root.mount(crm, namespace="crm")
root.mount(billing, namespace="billing")
root.mount(analytics, namespace="analytics")
```

`mount()` is live composition: the parent delegates to the child's provider rather than creating a one-time copied snapshot. ([Composition][4])

---

## 16.10 Mount vs import/copy

Prefer `mount()` when:

* child server remains a modular unit;
* child lifecycle/middleware/provider behavior matters;
* components may change dynamically;
* namespacing should be systematic.

Legacy copy/import semantics are useful only when you explicitly want a snapshot detached from future child changes. In v3, mount/provider composition is the default architectural primitive.

---

## 16.11 Proxy a remote MCP server

A `ProxyProvider` sources components through a FastMCP client connection to another server. The convenience server factory is `create_proxy()`.

Representative pattern:

```python
from fastmcp.server import create_proxy

proxy = create_proxy("https://upstream.example.com/mcp")
```

A proxy can translate transports—for example, local STDIO on one side and HTTP on the other—while preserving MCP operations. ([Proxy Provider][5])

---

## 16.12 Proxy use cases

```text
transport bridge
    local STDIO client -> FastMCP proxy -> remote HTTP backend

security gateway
    client -> authenticated/authorized proxy -> internal MCP server

aggregation
    client -> root FastMCP -> several ProxyProviders

stable endpoint
    client -> gateway URL -> moving/versioned upstream backends
```

Do not add a proxy merely because composition is possible; every proxy hop adds latency, failure modes, auth/token considerations, and observability requirements.

---

## 16.13 Proxy initialization correctness in 3.4

FastMCP 3.4 tightened proxy initialization: the proxy forwards initialization upstream so a missing backend, wrong endpoint, or failed authentication causes the proxy handshake to fail rather than presenting an apparently connected server with no components. ([FastMCP Updates][2])

Operational implication: health checks should include upstream initialization, not only "the proxy process is alive."

---

## 16.14 `fastmcp-remote` vs a general proxy server

`fastmcp-remote` packages the common remote-HTTP → local-STDIO bridge as a dedicated executable:

```bash
uvx fastmcp-remote https://example.com/mcp
```

Use it when a desktop/host only knows how to launch STDIO but the actual MCP server is remote. Use a normal FastMCP proxy application when you need custom middleware, authorization, transforms, multiple backends, custom routes, or deployment logic. ([fastmcp-remote][6])

---

## 16.15 Namespace remote providers

When aggregating several remote servers, namespace every provider unless their contracts are deliberately coordinated.

Conceptual:

```python
root = FastMCP("Gateway")
root.mount(weather_proxy, namespace="weather")
root.mount(calendar_proxy, namespace="calendar")
```

This produces stable public identities regardless of coincidental backend tool names such as `search`, `get`, or `list`.

---

## 16.16 Gateway auth boundary

A gateway can authenticate the caller independently from upstream credentials:

```text
client credential
    -> gateway verifies caller
    -> gateway authorization policy
    -> gateway uses service/upstream token
    -> upstream MCP server
```

This is often preferable to forwarding the user's raw inbound `Authorization` header to every upstream. FastMCP 3.x includes explicit hardening to prevent credential/header leakage across proxied/OpenAPI backends; preserve that separation in custom middleware. See §18/32.

---

## 16.17 Gateway catalog curation

A good MCP gateway does more than concatenate tool lists.

Recommended pipeline:

```text
ProxyProvider A ─┐
ProxyProvider B ─┼─> namespace
LocalProvider ───┘      -> curate descriptions/schemas
                          -> visibility allowlist
                          -> version policy
                          -> search / Code Mode
                          -> auth/authorization
```

A raw union of several large enterprise tool catalogs is usually worse for model performance than a curated discovery layer.

---

## 16.18 Proxy failure taxonomy

| Failure | Where to detect |
|---|---|
| upstream DNS/connect failure | initialization / client transport |
| wrong MCP path | initialization |
| upstream auth failure | initialization/call depending provider flow |
| schema changed | contract/fingerprint test |
| one upstream slow | per-backend timeout/telemetry |
| proxy auth succeeds, upstream auth fails | gateway trace should distinguish both hops |
| tool name collision | composition build/namespace policy |
| output validation mismatch | proxy/provider result conversion |

Correlate request IDs/traces across gateway and upstream when possible.

---

## 16.19 Search over aggregated providers

Search should run after the naming/curation steps whose outputs the model is expected to invoke.

```text
wrong conceptual order:
search backend raw names -> rename/namespace later

better:
namespace/transform -> search final public names
```

Otherwise search results may teach the model a name that is not the callable public name.

---

## 16.20 Tool descriptions become search index data

When using search transforms, descriptions and parameter descriptions are not merely UI documentation—they are retrieval text. Improve retrieval by:

* using distinctive action/domain language;
* documenting important nouns/objects;
* avoiding dozens of tools with identical generic descriptions;
* including parameter descriptions that distinguish similar tools;
* keeping deprecated/internal terminology out of public descriptions.

Treat tool documentation as retrieval quality engineering.

---

## 16.21 Code Mode suitability matrix

| Catalog/workflow | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| 10 simple tools | normal MCP listing usually simplest |
| 100+ tools, mostly single calls | search transform |
| 100+ tools, common multi-step pipelines | evaluate Code Mode |
| sensitive destructive tools | Code Mode only with strong auth/tool policy |
| highly dynamic generated API | search + curation; Code Mode if orchestration valuable |
| tool results are huge intermediates | Code Mode can substantially reduce model context |

---

## 16.22 Testing search and Code Mode

Test:

```text
search retrieves expected tools for domain terms
search does not expose disallowed tools
returned tool names are actually callable
namespaced names match search output
schema detail is sufficient for valid calls
Code Mode sandbox cannot bypass tool authorization
execution timeout/output limits work
multi-tool orchestration returns only intended final output
```

Do not evaluate only with one hand-picked prompt; use a query set representative of real tool-selection intents.

---

## 16.23 Anti-pattern inventory

* aggregating multiple servers without namespaces;
* publishing 1,000 tools directly because the protocol permits it;
* treating search-hidden tools as secure;
* enabling Code Mode without evaluating sandbox/tool side effects;
* passing raw inbound auth headers indiscriminately to proxied backends;
* health-checking only the gateway process and not upstream initialization;
* indexing raw backend names but publishing renamed/namespaced names;
* using a proxy where a direct client would be simpler and equally secure;
* duplicating child components into a parent rather than mounting providers;
* allowing one slow backend to consume the gateway's entire request budget.

---

## 16.24 Agent checklist

[ ] Estimate catalog size before choosing normal listing vs search.
[ ] Namespace every independently owned provider/server.
[ ] Curate generated/remote schemas before search indexing.

# FastMCP Advanced — 17) Authentication and authorization
### Authentication and authorization

**FastMCP 4 status.** Existing OAuth/token-verification patterns remain, augmented by provider-neutral role checks, richer insufficient-scope challenges, identity assertion (SEP-990 beta), and client-credentials auth. See §42.


### 17.0 Split the domain cleanly

In FastMCP, **authentication** answers “is this bearer token valid, and who issued it?” while **authorization** answers “given a validated token, which tools/resources/prompts may this caller see or execute?” The docs are explicit that when an `AuthProvider` is configured, unauthenticated MCP-endpoint requests are rejected at the transport boundary before authorization checks run; authorization then differentiates among authenticated callers based on scopes and claims. ([FastMCP][1])

Authentication is only meaningful on HTTP-based transports. The auth overview states it applies to FastMCP’s HTTP transports (`http` and `sse`), while the authorization docs phrase the same boundary as OAuth tokens being available only on SSE and Streamable HTTP; both agree that STDIO inherits security from the local execution environment and that auth checks are skipped there because there is no OAuth concept. ([FastMCP][1])

At deployment time, auth providers also own the server’s discovery/operational auth surface. The auth SDK documents `get_routes(mcp_path)` and `get_middleware()` on auth providers; `TokenVerifier` typically contributes no auth routes, `RemoteAuthProvider` contributes protected-resource metadata routes, and `OAuthProvider` contributes full authorization-server routes. ([FastMCP][2])

---

## 17.1 Authentication: choose the right provider family

### 17.1.1 `TokenVerifier`: pure token validation, no OAuth discovery

Use a bare `TokenVerifier` when clients already know how to obtain tokens and your server only needs to validate them. The token-verification docs define this as the “pure resource server” pattern: token issuance happens elsewhere, FastMCP validates signatures/claims and makes access decisions locally. This is best for internal systems, API-gateway-backed services, or environments where client token acquisition is already solved outside MCP discovery. ([FastMCP][3])

FastMCP documents multiple verifier families under this pattern. `JWTVerifier` supports JWKS-based validation against an issuer and audience, static public keys, and HMAC/shared-secret validation for internal systems; `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` supports RFC 7662 opaque-token introspection; `StaticTokenVerifier` is explicitly development/testing-only; and `DebugTokenVerifier` exists for flexible test/prototyping scenarios. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="9zt3vb"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

auth = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://auth.example.com",
    audience="mcp-api",
)

mcp = FastMCP("Protected API", auth=auth)
```

That pattern validates bearer tokens but does not expose OAuth discovery metadata for automated MCP client registration/login flows. It is therefore the right choice only when token acquisition is already handled elsewhere or preconfigured on clients. ([FastMCP][3])

### 17.1.2 `RemoteAuthProvider`: DCR-capable external IdP integration

Use `RemoteAuthProvider` when the upstream identity provider supports **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**. The remote-oauth docs define this as the fully automated MCP-native path: clients discover auth requirements, dynamically register, and obtain credentials without manual console setup. `RemoteAuthProvider` composes a `TokenVerifier` with trusted authorization-server metadata and emits standardized OAuth protected-resource discovery endpoints. ([FastMCP][4])

The docs are explicit that `RemoteAuthProvider` is verifier-agnostic: pair it with `JWTVerifier` for self-contained tokens, `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` for RFC 7662 opaque tokens, or a custom verifier if needed. The key requirement is not token format but DCR support at the identity provider. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="yi47gv"
from pydantic import AnyHttpUrl
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import RemoteAuthProvider
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

token_verifier = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://auth.example.com",
    audience="mcp-api",
)

auth = RemoteAuthProvider(
    token_verifier=token_verifier,
    authorization_servers=[AnyHttpUrl("https://auth.example.com")],
    base_url="https://api.example.com",
    allowed_client_redirect_uris=["http://localhost:*", "http://127.0.0.1:*"],
)

mcp = FastMCP("Company API", auth=auth)
```

The high-value parameters here are `token_verifier` for local token validation, `authorization_servers` to advertise which issuers the resource server trusts, `base_url` to identify the MCP server in OAuth metadata, and optional client redirect-URI restrictions for tighter registration policy. ([FastMCP][5])

### 17.1.3 `OAuthProxy`: bridge non-DCR OAuth providers

Use `OAuthProxy` when the upstream provider **does not** support DCR. The OAuth-proxy docs state this covers most traditional OAuth providers and enterprise identity systems, including GitHub, Google, Azure, AWS, Discord, and similar providers requiring manual app registration and fixed credentials. `OAuthProxy` presents a DCR-compliant surface to MCP clients while using your pre-registered upstream client ID/secret behind the scenes. ([FastMCP][6])

Its core value is callback forwarding. MCP clients often use dynamic localhost redirect URIs or fixed client-hosted callbacks, while traditional providers want one fixed redirect URI registered in advance. `OAuthProxy` stores the client’s dynamic callback URI, performs upstream auth using the server’s fixed callback, then forwards the result back to the client. The docs also say PKCE forwarding is enabled by default, and client redirect URIs can be restricted with wildcard-capable allowlists. ([FastMCP][6])

```python id="7zctv6"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import OAuthProxy
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

token_verifier = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://accounts.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://accounts.example.com",
    audience="my-upstream-app-id",
)

auth = OAuthProxy(
    upstream_authorization_endpoint="https://accounts.example.com/oauth/authorize",
    upstream_token_endpoint="https://accounts.example.com/oauth/token",
    upstream_client_id="client-id",
    upstream_client_secret="client-secret",
    token_verifier=token_verifier,
    base_url="https://mcp.example.com",
    allowed_client_redirect_uris=[
        "http://localhost:*",
        "http://127.0.0.1:*",
        "https://*.example.com/*",
    ],
)

mcp = FastMCP("Proxy-Protected Server", auth=auth)
```

The key constructor fields are the upstream authorization/token endpoints, your upstream app credentials, a `TokenVerifier` for the returned tokens, `base_url`, optional `redirect_path`, optional `issuer_url`, and optional allowed client redirect-URI patterns. The docs also emphasize that the provider-console redirect URI must exactly match `base_url + redirect_path`. ([FastMCP][6])

### 17.1.4 `OIDCProxy`: OAuthProxy plus OIDC discovery

Use `OIDCProxy` when the upstream provider exposes a standard OpenID Connect discovery document (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) but still is not a clean DCR fit for MCP. The OIDC-proxy docs describe it as being built on `OAuthProxy` while automatically discovering endpoints from the provider’s OIDC configuration, which reduces manual endpoint wiring and is a better fit for Auth0/Google/Azure/AWS-style providers with OIDC metadata. ([FastMCP][7])

```python id="tr7gxy"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.oidc_proxy import OIDCProxy

auth = OIDCProxy(
    config_url="https://login.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    client_id="client-id",
    client_secret="client-secret",
    base_url="https://mcp.example.com",
    audience="https://api.example.com",  # for providers that require an API audience
)

mcp = FastMCP("OIDC-Protected Server", auth=auth)
```

The high-value OIDC-specific parameters are `config_url`, `audience`, `strict`, `timeout_seconds`, and optional `token_verifier` override. If you already know you need a custom verifier, supply it directly; otherwise OIDCProxy can synthesize a default `JWTVerifier` from discovery metadata. ([FastMCP][7])

### 17.1.5 `OAuthProvider`: full in-server authorization server

Use `OAuthProvider` only when your MCP server must itself become the authorization server. The full-oauth docs are unusually direct: this is an extremely advanced pattern most users should avoid, because secure OAuth 2.1 implementation requires deep protocol, cryptography, storage, and operational-security expertise. The docs recommend external identity providers unless you have requirements they cannot meet, such as air-gapped or specialized-compliance deployments. ([FastMCP][8])

`OAuthProvider` is abstract. You must subclass it and implement client management, authorization flow, and token-management methods such as `get_client`, `register_client`, `authorize`, `load_authorization_code`, `exchange_authorization_code`, `load_refresh_token`, `exchange_refresh_token`, `load_access_token`, `revoke_token`, and `verify_token`. FastMCP supplies the protocol/route shell; you supply storage, user auth, consent, and token lifecycle logic. ([FastMCP][8])

```python id="ih3mru"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.oauth import OAuthProvider

class MyOAuthProvider(OAuthProvider):
    async def get_client(self, client_id): ...
    async def register_client(self, client_info): ...
    async def authorize(self, client, params): ...
    async def load_authorization_code(self, client, authorization_code): ...
    async def exchange_authorization_code(self, client, authorization_code): ...
    async def load_refresh_token(self, client, refresh_token): ...
    async def exchange_refresh_token(self, client, refresh_token, scopes): ...
    async def load_access_token(self, token): ...
    async def revoke_token(self, token): ...
    async def verify_token(self, token): ...

mcp = FastMCP("Auth Server", auth=MyOAuthProvider(...))
```

Treat this as an explicit last-resort architecture, not a default. The docs emphasize that implementation complexity extends far beyond initial coding into ongoing security maintenance. ([FastMCP][8])

### 17.1.6 `MultiAuth`: multiple token sources, one server

Use `MultiAuth` when one FastMCP server must accept tokens from multiple sources. The docs define the canonical case as an interactive path authenticating through `OAuthProxy` or another auth server, plus machine-to-machine JWTs validated directly through one or more `TokenVerifier`s. `MultiAuth` composes them into one `auth=` object. ([FastMCP][9])

Verification order is deterministic: the auth server, if present, is tried first; additional verifiers are then tried in list order; the first successful verification wins. The server, if present, owns OAuth routes and metadata, while verifiers contribute only token-verification logic. This keeps discovery clean while expanding acceptable token sources. ([FastMCP][9])

```python id="u4v2pi"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import MultiAuth, OAuthProxy
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

auth = MultiAuth(
    server=OAuthProxy(
        upstream_authorization_endpoint="https://login.example.com/oauth/authorize",
        upstream_token_endpoint="https://login.example.com/oauth/token",
        upstream_client_id="interactive-client",
        upstream_client_secret="interactive-secret",
        token_verifier=JWTVerifier(
            jwks_uri="https://login.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
            issuer="https://login.example.com",
            audience="interactive-client",
        ),
        base_url="https://mcp.example.com",
    ),
    verifiers=[
        JWTVerifier(
            jwks_uri="https://internal-issuer.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
            issuer="https://internal-issuer.example.com",
            audience="mcp.example.com",
        )
    ],
)

mcp = FastMCP("Hybrid Auth Server", auth=auth)
```

If you pass only verifiers and no server, `MultiAuth` still works, but no OAuth routes or discovery metadata are served. The docs recommend that shape for internal systems where clients already know how to obtain tokens. ([FastMCP][9])

### 17.1.7 Decision framework

Use **plain `TokenVerifier`** when clients already know token acquisition and you only need validation. Use **`RemoteAuthProvider`** when the upstream IdP supports DCR and you want MCP-native automated client registration. Use **`OIDCProxy`** when the upstream provider exposes OIDC discovery but does not cleanly support DCR for MCP. Use **`OAuthProxy`** when the upstream provider lacks DCR and you must bridge fixed upstream credentials to MCP’s dynamic client expectations. Use **`MultiAuth`** when more than one token source must be accepted. Use **`OAuthProvider`** only when you must issue and manage tokens yourself. This exact split is the combined guidance of the authentication overview, remote-oauth docs, OAuth-proxy docs, OIDC-proxy docs, and MultiAuth docs. ([FastMCP][1])

### 17.1.8 Deployment advisories for authentication

Configure auth providers programmatically via `auth=...` on `FastMCP(...)`, and keep secrets such as client secrets in environment variables rather than hardcoding them. The authentication overview explicitly recommends environment-based secret loading while keeping dependencies explicit in code. ([FastMCP][1])

If you proxy or mount the server under a path, remember that auth providers contribute discovery/operational routes, and path/base-URL correctness becomes part of the auth contract. This is especially important for `OAuthProxy`/`OIDCProxy`, where `base_url`, callback path, and optionally `issuer_url` govern discovery and redirect correctness. ([FastMCP][6])

---

## 17.2 Authorization: callable checks over authenticated requests

FastMCP authorization is callable-based. The authorization docs define an auth check as any sync or async callable receiving `AuthContext` and returning `True` or `False`; multiple checks combine with AND semantics. `AuthorizationError` may be raised for explicit denial messages, while other exceptions are masked for security and treated as denial. `AuthContext` exposes the current `token` and the `component` being accessed. ([FastMCP][10])

Because unauthenticated requests are already rejected at the transport boundary when an auth provider is configured, authorization logic is typically about **scope/claim/component-policy decisions**, not “is there a token at all?” The docs say this explicitly. In STDIO, there is no OAuth mechanism, so `get_access_token()` returns `None` and auth checks are skipped. ([FastMCP][10])

### 17.2.1 `require_scopes(...)`

`require_scopes(*scopes)` is the canonical scope gate. The authorization docs and SDK both state that it requires **all** specified scopes to be present on the token; multiple scopes inside one `require_scopes(...)` call are therefore AND-combined. ([FastMCP][10])

```python id="q4cbgz"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import require_scopes

mcp = FastMCP("Scoped Server")

@mcp.tool(auth=require_scopes("admin"))
def admin_operation() -> str:
    return "Admin action completed"

@mcp.tool(auth=require_scopes("read", "write"))
def read_write_operation() -> str:
    return "Read/write action completed"
```

Use `require_scopes(...)` for direct component ownership rules: “this operation always requires these scopes.” It is the most precise component-level authorization primitive FastMCP ships. ([FastMCP][10])

### 17.2.2 `restrict_tag(...)`

`restrict_tag(tag, scopes=[...])` is the conditional/tag-driven policy primitive. The authorization docs say it applies required scopes **only if** the component has the specified tag; untagged components are unaffected. This makes it the right primitive for server-wide or group-wide policy layered over a shared component catalog. ([FastMCP][10])

```python id="h7y7ib"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import restrict_tag
from fastmcp.server.middleware import AuthMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Tagged Server",
    middleware=[
        AuthMiddleware(auth=restrict_tag("admin", scopes=["admin"]))
    ],
)

@mcp.tool(tags={"admin"})
def delete_all_data() -> str:
    return "Deleted"

@mcp.tool(tags={"public"})
def read_status() -> str:
    return "OK"
```

Use `restrict_tag(...)` when the same policy should apply to many components without repeating `auth=` on each one, or when mounted/proxied/server-composed components should inherit policy from shared tags. ([FastMCP][10])

### 17.2.3 AND-composition of checks

FastMCP combines checks with AND semantics in two places. First, passing a list to `auth=[...]` on a component means all checks must pass. Second, component-level `auth=` and server-level `AuthMiddleware(auth=...)` are both evaluated, and both must pass. The docs explicitly spell out both forms of AND-composition. ([FastMCP][10])

```python id="qj7ocg"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import require_scopes, restrict_tag
from fastmcp.server.middleware import AuthMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Layered Auth Server",
    middleware=[AuthMiddleware(auth=restrict_tag("admin", scopes=["admin"]))],
)

@mcp.tool(auth=[require_scopes("write"), require_scopes("audit")], tags={"admin"})
def admin_write() -> str:
    return "Admin write"
```

The effective policy here is: caller must satisfy both component-level checks (`write` AND `audit`) and the middleware-enforced tag rule (`admin` for `admin`-tagged components). ([FastMCP][10])

### 17.2.4 Custom and async auth checks

Any callable `AuthContext -> bool` is a valid auth check, and the docs explicitly say checks may be asynchronous. This means authorization can inspect token claims, component metadata, or even external services/state before allowing access. The SDK’s `run_auth_checks(...)` supports sync and async check functions with the same AND semantics. ([FastMCP][10])

```python id="sq9mgo"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import AuthContext, AuthorizationError

mcp = FastMCP("CustomAuth")

def require_verified_email(ctx: AuthContext) -> bool:
    if ctx.token is None:
        raise AuthorizationError("Authentication required")
    if not ctx.token.claims.get("email_verified"):
        raise AuthorizationError("Email verification required")
    return True

@mcp.tool(auth=require_verified_email)
def sensitive_operation() -> str:
    return "Allowed"
```

Use custom checks when `require_scopes` and `restrict_tag` are too coarse. Typical reasons: claim-based org/tenant membership, component-metadata-driven policy, external ACL lookups, or temporal/business-policy checks. ([FastMCP][10])

### 17.2.5 Component-level authorization

Component-level authorization is set with the `auth=` parameter on `@mcp.tool`, `@mcp.resource`, and `@mcp.prompt`. The authorization docs say this controls **both** visibility and access: unauthorized components are filtered out of list responses, and direct access behaves as not-found for unauthorized requests. ([FastMCP][10])

```python id="63zrq4"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import require_scopes

mcp = FastMCP("ComponentAuth")

@mcp.tool(auth=require_scopes("write"))
def write_tool() -> str:
    return "Written"

@mcp.resource("secret://data", auth=require_scopes("read"))
def secret_resource() -> str:
    return "Secret data"

@mcp.prompt(auth=require_scopes("admin"))
def admin_prompt() -> str:
    return "Admin prompt content"
```

Use component-level auth when the rule is intrinsic to the component itself. This is the lowest-friction way to encode “this capability is only for X-scoped callers.” ([FastMCP][10])

### 17.2.6 Server-level authorization via `AuthMiddleware`

For global policy, use `AuthMiddleware`. The middleware SDK says it applies auth checks to all components, filters list responses, checks authorization before tool execution/resource reads/prompt renders, and skips all checks on STDIO. Its `auth=` parameter accepts a single check or a list, again with AND semantics. ([FastMCP][11])

```python id="6r2jlwm"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import require_scopes
from fastmcp.server.middleware import AuthMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Enforced Auth Server",
    middleware=[AuthMiddleware(auth=require_scopes("api"))],
)

@mcp.tool
def any_tool() -> str:
    return "Protected"
```

The docs contrast this with component-level auth: middleware is for server-wide baseline policy; component auth is for per-component requirements. In practice, use middleware for coarse mandatory gates like “all operations require `api`” and component auth for finer capability-specific constraints. ([FastMCP][11])

### 17.2.7 Component auth + middleware auth

FastMCP treats component-level `auth` and `AuthMiddleware` as complementary layers. The authorization docs explicitly say both layers are checked and all checks must pass. This is the correct way to express “global minimum policy plus local stricter policy.” ([FastMCP][10])

That means the recommended layered pattern is:

* middleware for baseline rules (`api`, tenancy, tag gates, org-wide constraints)
* component `auth=` for component-specific scopes/claims. ([FastMCP][10])

### 17.2.8 Access-token-aware tools

Authorization answers “may this run?” but tools often need the token after authorization to personalize behavior, inspect claims, or call downstream services on behalf of the user. The authorization docs explicitly recommend `get_access_token()` for this, and the DI SDK documents `CurrentAccessToken()` as the stricter injected form that raises when no authenticated user exists. ([FastMCP][12])

Optional access pattern:

```python id="jlwmzm"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token

mcp = FastMCP("TokenAware")

@mcp.tool
def personalized_greeting() -> str:
    token = get_access_token()
    if token is None:
        return "Hello, guest!"
    name = token.claims.get("name", "user")
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

Required-token DI pattern:

```python id="4ewrq3"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.dependencies import CurrentAccessToken
from fastmcp.server.auth import AccessToken

mcp = FastMCP("StrictTokenAware")

@mcp.tool
def user_dashboard(token: AccessToken = CurrentAccessToken()) -> dict:
    return {
        "sub": token.claims.get("sub"),
        "scopes": token.scopes,
        "client_id": token.client_id,
    }
```

Use `get_access_token()` when behavior can degrade for anonymous/no-token contexts; use `CurrentAccessToken()` when the tool should fail immediately if no authenticated principal exists. The DI SDK is explicit that `CurrentAccessToken()` raises without authentication, while `get_access_token()` is the optional form. ([FastMCP][13])

### 17.2.9 Best-practice authorization advisory

Encode stable, intrinsic rules at the component with `auth=`; encode organization-wide baselines with `AuthMiddleware`; layer them deliberately when both are needed. Use scopes for hard capability gates, tags for broad policy classification, and custom checks only when claim/tag/scope patterns are insufficient. That guidance follows directly from FastMCP’s documented split between component-level auth, tag-restriction helpers, and middleware-wide checks. ([FastMCP][10])

Do not use authorization as a substitute for authentication. Once an `AuthProvider` is configured, unauthenticated requests are already blocked at the transport boundary; your authorization layer should assume it is evaluating authenticated principals and make decisions on scopes, claims, and component metadata. ([FastMCP][10])

# FastMCP Advanced — 18) Advanced security policy and identity-aware execution


**FastMCP 4 status.** Add modern request-state sealing, task-snapshot encryption, identity assertions, role/scope separation, protocol-era behavior, and safe gateway routing to the security model.

## 18.0 Security model: five boundaries

A production FastMCP server typically has at least five distinct security boundaries:

```text
1. transport boundary
   -> who can reach the MCP endpoint?

2. authentication boundary
   -> who is the caller?

3. authorization boundary
   -> what may this caller list/call/read/render?

4. capability boundary
   -> what can each tool/resource actually do downstream?

5. data/tenant boundary
   -> which records/secrets/accounts can that operation access?
```

FastMCP can directly help with the first three and with tool publication, but application code still owns domain-level authorization and data isolation. ([Authentication][1]) ([Authorization][2])

---

## 18.1 Token auth is an HTTP boundary

FastMCP's OAuth/token authentication applies to HTTP-based transports. STDIO is a local process/launcher trust boundary; do not assume `auth=` protects a subprocess connection in the same way.

```text
HTTP -> token verifier / OAuth provider -> access token -> auth checks
STDIO -> OS/process/host configuration trust boundary
```

If a local STDIO tool can perform privileged actions, secure the host config, executable path, filesystem permissions, and any local credentials it can access. ([Authentication][1])

---

## 18.2 Authentication is not authorization

Authentication answers:

```text
"This token belongs to subject X with claims/scopes Y"
```

Authorization answers:

```text
"Subject X may perform action Z on resource R in tenant T"
```

Do not write:

```python
if get_access_token() is not None:
    return sensitive_data
```

when the actual policy needs tenant/resource-level checks.

---

## 18.3 Component-level auth

Sensitive components can attach authorization checks directly:

```python
from fastmcp.server.auth import require_scopes


@mcp.tool(auth=require_scopes("orders:write"))
async def create_order(...):
    ...
```

This has two benefits:

* unauthorized components can be filtered from catalog listing;
* exact-name/direct calls still enforce the same policy.

Use component-level policy for capability-specific checks; use middleware/server policy for broad cross-cutting rules. ([Authorization][2])

---

## 18.4 Access-token injection

Use FastMCP dependency injection to obtain the validated token/claims rather than reparsing raw HTTP headers in every tool.

Conceptual:

```python
from fastmcp.dependencies import CurrentAccessToken


@mcp.tool
async def who_am_i(token=CurrentAccessToken()) -> dict:
    return {
        "subject": token.claims.get("sub"),
        "scope": token.claims.get("scope"),
    }
```

The exact token type is part of the auth provider/SDK surface. Keep business logic behind a typed identity abstraction if many tools need the same claims. ([DI][3])

---

## 18.5 Build an application identity object

Prefer one dependency that validates/normalizes business identity:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from fastmcp.dependencies import Depends


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Principal:
    subject: str
    tenant_id: str
    roles: frozenset[str]


async def get_principal(token=CurrentAccessToken()) -> Principal:
    claims = token.claims
    return Principal(
        subject=claims["sub"],
        tenant_id=claims["tenant_id"],
        roles=frozenset(claims.get("roles", [])),
    )


@mcp.tool
async def get_invoice(
    invoice_id: str,
    principal: Principal = Depends(get_principal),
) -> dict:
    return await invoice_service.get_for_tenant(
        principal.tenant_id,
        invoice_id,
    )
```

This prevents every tool from implementing slightly different claim parsing.

---

## 18.6 Scope checks vs resource checks

A scope such as `invoices:read` is normally necessary but not sufficient for multi-tenant access.

```text
scope check:
    may call invoice-read capability

resource check:
    invoice belongs to caller's tenant / permitted account
```

Enforce both where applicable.

---

## 18.7 Visibility is not the security boundary

A component hidden by tag/visibility/search transforms may still exist in the server graph. Therefore:

```text
visibility -> model/client discoverability
component auth -> execution/read/render permission
```

Use visibility to reduce confusion and exposure; use auth to prevent access.

---

## 18.8 Token verifier invariants

For JWT/OIDC-style verification, configure and validate at least:

* expected issuer;
* expected audience/resource indicator;
* signature algorithm/key source;
* expiration/not-before semantics;
* required subject/tenant claims;
* scope/role claim format;
* acceptable clock skew;
* JWKS refresh/failure behavior.

Never validate only a JWT signature and assume every token signed by the issuer was intended for your MCP server.

---

## 18.9 Patch-level auth fixes matter

FastMCP 3.4.x shipped multiple authentication/security fixes, including:

* IPv6 transition-address handling in SSRF protections;
* Host/Origin validation for DNS rebinding hardening;
* OAuth redirect restrictions;
* JWKS handling of unsupported key types;
* Azure audience/scope compatibility;
* trusted proxy support for protected metadata/JWKS fetching;
* CIMD client assertion audience correction.

This is why production deployments should review patch release notes rather than treating `3.4.0` and `3.4.7` as security-equivalent. ([FastMCP Updates][4])

---

## 18.10 OAuth Proxy trust boundary

`OAuthProxy` can bridge clients to an upstream provider that does not implement every MCP-oriented OAuth behavior directly. Model the token paths explicitly:

```text
MCP client
  -> FastMCP authorization interface
  -> FastMCP-managed client/token state
  -> upstream identity provider
  -> upstream access/refresh token
  -> client-facing FastMCP token/session
```

Never log access/refresh tokens. Ensure token caches are partitioned by identity/client context and have bounded expiry. ([OAuth Proxy][5])

---

## 18.11 CIMD and client assertions

Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) can reduce reliance on Dynamic Client Registration in compatible flows. FastMCP 3.4.7 specifically fixed `private_key_jwt` audience validation for bare-origin OAuth Proxy deployments. If you use client assertions:

* validate the assertion audience against the exact advertised token endpoint;
* verify signature/key ownership;
* enforce `exp`/`iat`/replay protections;
* test reverse-proxy URL normalization;
* pin the patch release containing known audience fixes.

See client and auth chapters for API details. ([FastMCP 3.4.7][6])

---

## 18.12 Proxy credential separation

Gateway anti-pattern:

```text
receive Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN
forward same header to every upstream service
```

Better:

```text
validate USER_TOKEN at gateway
derive Principal
apply gateway policy
use backend-specific credential / delegated token only for intended upstream
```

FastMCP has shipped fixes specifically around avoiding inbound auth-header leakage to unrelated proxy/OpenAPI backends. Preserve that boundary in custom middleware. ([FastMCP Updates][4])

---

## 18.13 OpenAPI-generated tools and credentials

When an OpenAPI provider uses an `httpx` client with backend credentials, those credentials are server-side capabilities. Do not expose them as LLM tool arguments.

```text
LLM supplies: endpoint business parameters
server supplies: backend auth headers, base URL, TLS settings
```

If tenants use different upstream credentials, inject the appropriate client/credential through authenticated identity and avoid one global privileged client.

---

## 18.14 SSRF posture

Any feature that fetches remote URLs based on metadata or user/provider configuration can become an SSRF surface. Threats include:

* `127.0.0.1` / RFC1918 targets;
* link-local/cloud metadata endpoints;
* IPv6-mapped/private targets;
* DNS rebinding;
* redirects from public to private addresses;
* proxy bypass;
* URL parser discrepancies.

FastMCP 3.4.x hardened OAuth metadata/JWKS fetches and IPv6 transition forms; do not replace those utilities with naive `httpx.get(user_url)` logic in custom auth. ([FastMCP Updates][4])

---

## 18.15 Trusted corporate proxies

FastMCP 3.4.6 added trusted-proxy support for SSRF-protected OAuth metadata/JWKS fetches. Enterprise egress designs should fail closed if protected fetching requires a mandated proxy and that proxy is unavailable, rather than silently bypassing it with a direct connection. ([FastMCP Updates][4])

Operationally test:

```text
proxy configured and reachable
proxy configured but unavailable
custom CA trust chain
no proxy configured when policy requires one
upstream redirect behavior through proxy
```

---

## 18.16 DNS rebinding / Host / Origin

A localhost-bound HTTP MCP server can still be targeted through a malicious browser if Host/Origin handling is weak. FastMCP 3.4.3 added Host/Origin validation and 3.4.4 adjusted defaults for deployment compatibility.

Production rule:

* if you know the public host(s), configure allowed hosts;
* if browser origins are relevant, configure allowed origins;
* verify reverse proxy rewrites/preserved host behavior;
* test both accepted and rejected Host/Origin cases;
* do not assume binding to `127.0.0.1` alone eliminates DNS-rebinding risk.

See §20/32 for deployment configuration. ([FastMCP Updates][4])

---

## 18.17 Destructive tool policy

MCP annotations such as destructive/read-only hints improve client UX but are not authorization.

For destructive tools:

```text
1. authenticate caller
2. authorize capability/resource
3. validate input
4. optionally require workflow approval/elicitation
5. perform operation with idempotency/concurrency controls
6. audit outcome
```

Use an app Approval provider or explicit workflow state for human confirmation when appropriate, but keep server-side authorization mandatory.

---

## 18.18 Least-privilege tool design

Prefer:

```text
issue_refund(order_id, amount)
```

over:

```text
execute_sql(sql)
execute_shell(command)
http_request(method, url, headers, body)
```

General-purpose escape hatches make policy difficult to reason about. If they are unavoidable, constrain destination/action/identity/arguments and isolate them behind stronger authorization.

---

## 18.19 Sandboxed-agent capability boundary

For isolated agents, FastMCP can act as the boundary that keeps long-lived upstream credentials outside the sandbox:

```text
sandboxed agent
   -> short-lived scoped MCP token
   -> FastMCP server
   -> privileged internal systems
```

The sandbox gets capabilities, not root credentials. Prefer remote HTTP for this architecture because authentication, revocation, and audit are centralized. ([Sandboxed Agents][7])

---

## 18.20 Error masking and information disclosure

Internet-facing servers should generally avoid exposing arbitrary Python exception details. Use `mask_error_details` and intentional tool/domain errors to control what clients learn.

Do not leak:

* filesystem paths;
* database connection strings;
* upstream tokens;
* internal hostnames;
* stack traces;
* authorization rule implementation details.

Log full diagnostic context server-side with appropriate redaction/correlation IDs.

---

## 18.21 Audit model

For sensitive actions, capture at least:

```text
timestamp
request / trace ID
principal subject
principal tenant
public tool key + version
validated arguments or redacted digest
policy decision
backend target / resource ID
result class (success / denied / error)
latency
```

Do not blindly log raw tool arguments if they can contain PII, secrets, or large payloads.

---

## 18.22 Authorization tests

Minimum test matrix:

```text
no token -> rejected
invalid signature -> rejected
wrong issuer -> rejected
wrong audience -> rejected
expired token -> rejected
valid token / missing scope -> hidden or denied
valid scope / wrong tenant -> denied
valid tenant -> allowed
exact-name call of hidden privileged tool -> still denied
proxy path does not forward caller credential to unrelated backend
```

Also test list visibility separately from direct execution.

---

## 18.23 Security anti-pattern inventory

* equating authentication with authorization;
* using tags/visibility as the sole security boundary;
* forwarding inbound Authorization headers to every upstream;
* verifying JWT signature without issuer/audience;
* exposing backend API tokens as tool parameters;
* user-controlled arbitrary URL fetches in auth/tools with no SSRF policy;
* binding localhost and assuming DNS rebinding is impossible;
* letting destructive tool annotations stand in for enforcement;
* logging full access/refresh tokens or secrets;
* putting tenant IDs from tool arguments ahead of authenticated tenant claims;
* running broad shell/SQL/HTTP escape-hatch tools with ordinary user scopes;
* leaving a known auth/security patch behind because major/minor version did not change.

---

## 18.24 Security checklist

```text
[ ] Classify transport trust: STDIO vs HTTP.
[ ] Validate token signature + issuer + audience + expiry.
[ ] Normalize claims into a typed Principal dependency.
[ ] Enforce capability and resource/tenant authorization.
[ ] Attach component auth to sensitive components.
[ ] Treat visibility/search as discoverability, not enforcement.
[ ] Separate caller credentials from backend credentials.
[ ] Use FastMCP SSRF-safe auth fetching rather than custom naive URL retrieval.
[ ] Configure Host/Origin policy for HTTP deployment shape.
[ ] Pin security-relevant 3.4.x patch releases.
[ ] Mask internal errors in public deployments.
[ ] Audit sensitive tool calls with redaction.
[ ] Test direct-call attempts against hidden/unauthorized tools.

# FastMCP Advanced — 19) Running and deploying servers
### Running and deploying servers

**FastMCP 4 status.** A v4 server may serve modern sessionless and legacy handshake-era clients concurrently. Deployment tests must therefore validate era negotiation as well as transport selection.


### 19.0 Runtime surface: what actually binds a server to the outside world

Server construction defines the MCP surface; runtime methods bind that surface to a transport. The primary entrypoints are `run()`, `run_async()`, `run_http_async()`, and `http_app()`. The SDK transport surface documents the accepted transport literals for the top-level runtime APIs as `"stdio"`, `"http"`, `"sse"`, and `"streamable-http"`, while the prose deployment docs describe the transport families as **STDIO**, **HTTP / Streamable HTTP**, and **SSE (legacy)**. For agent-authored code, the safest reading is: use `transport="http"` for the recommended Streamable HTTP mode, `transport="stdio"` for subprocess/local integrations, and `transport="sse"` only for backward compatibility. ([FastMCP][1])

`run()` is the primary runtime entrypoint for simple deployment. The running guide says it starts the server, blocks until stopped, and handles connection management; the same guide also states that `run()` is a synchronous wrapper around the async implementation, while `run_async()` is the correct choice inside an already-async context. The transport SDK confirms both methods share the same transport surface. ([FastMCP][2])

### 19.1 `mcp.run()` — primary entrypoint, blocking semantics, and `__main__`

The canonical local/server script shape is:

```python id="xej7vt"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

This is not stylistic decoration. The running guide explicitly says `run()` should live under `if __name__ == "__main__":` for maximum compatibility, so the server starts only when the file is executed directly and not when the module is imported by another Python process. For LLM-generated server files, that guard should be treated as mandatory unless the server is intentionally CLI-only or embedded in another runtime. ([FastMCP][2])

The async equivalent is:

```python id="eejc6b"
import asyncio
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

async def main():
    await mcp.run_async(transport="http", port=8000)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The docs are explicit: `run()` cannot be called from inside an async function because it creates its own event loop; use `run_async()` in async contexts, and use `run()` in synchronous contexts. Both accept the same transport arguments. ([FastMCP][2])

### 19.2 Transport selection: STDIO vs Streamable HTTP vs SSE

FastMCP’s human-facing docs divide runtime transport choice into three deployment classes: **STDIO** for local single-process/subprocess-style use, **HTTP / Streamable HTTP** for remote or multi-client network services, and **SSE** only for older clients that have not moved to Streamable HTTP. The SDK transport page complements that by showing the accepted runtime literals. ([FastMCP][2])

#### STDIO

STDIO is the default when you call `run()` with no transport. The docs say it communicates over standard input/output, that the client spawns a new server process per session, and that it is ideal for local development, Claude Desktop, command-line tools, and single-user applications. Architecturally: choose STDIO when the client owns process lifecycle and there is no need for a shared network-reachable endpoint. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="8kg7gn"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # default: STDIO
```

#### HTTP / Streamable HTTP

The running guide says HTTP transport turns the server into a URL-addressable web service, uses the Streamable HTTP protocol, supports full bidirectional communication and streaming responses, and is the recommended choice for network-based deployments. Unlike STDIO, one HTTP server can handle multiple concurrent clients. The HTTP deployment guide further says remote HTTP is how you unlock centralized services, multi-client access, and cloud deployment. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="conryv"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

By default, that yields an MCP endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`; both `run()` and `http_app()` also accept a custom `path=` if you want a different route such as `/api/mcp/`. ([FastMCP][2])

#### SSE

SSE is still supported, but the running guide calls it the original HTTP-based transport, explicitly labels it legacy, states that it only supports server-to-client streaming, and recommends HTTP instead for all new projects. SSE exists for backward compatibility with older clients, not as a default design target. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="tlku4f"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="sse", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

#### Decision rule

A concise deployment rule follows directly from the docs: choose **STDIO** for local, client-spawned, single-user integrations; choose **HTTP / Streamable HTTP** for remote services, multiple clients, and production network deployment; choose **SSE** only when a required client still depends on it. The docs phrase this decision almost exactly that way. ([FastMCP][2])

### 19.3 Direct HTTP server vs ASGI deployment

FastMCP documents two HTTP deployment styles: direct HTTP via `run(transport="http", ...)`, and ASGI deployment via `http_app()`. The HTTP deployment guide states that the direct HTTP server is simpler and better for quick standalone deployments, while the ASGI path is better when you need multiple workers, custom middleware, or integration with existing infrastructure. ([FastMCP][3])

#### Direct HTTP: fastest path to a standalone service

```python id="wj1dhf"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My Server")

@mcp.tool
def process_data(input: str) -> str:
    return f"Processed: {input}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

The docs position this as ideal for internal tools, development environments, and simple deployments where the MCP server is the only thing on the port and you do not need higher-order ASGI features. ([FastMCP][3])

#### ASGI: production-oriented deployment primitive

`http_app()` is the ASGI-export path. The transport SDK defines:

```python id="dffw41"
http_app(
    path: str | None = None,
    middleware: list[ASGIMiddleware] | None = None,
    json_response: bool | None = None,
    stateless_http: bool | None = None,
    transport: Literal["http", "streamable-http", "sse"] = "http",
    event_store: EventStore | None = None,
    retry_interval: int | None = None,
) -> StarletteWithLifespan
```

That makes `http_app()` the correct choice when FastMCP needs to become a standard ASGI sub-application, when Uvicorn/Gunicorn/Hypercorn should own process management, or when you need deployment-time control over middleware, workers, and reverse-proxy behavior. The HTTP deployment guide explicitly recommends it for advanced server options, multiple workers, and mounting into larger web applications. ([FastMCP][1])

Minimal ASGI export:

```python id="nl3nq7"
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My Server")

@mcp.tool
def process_data(input: str) -> str:
    return f"Processed: {input}"

app = mcp.http_app()
```

Run with Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The docs say the default URL remains `http://localhost:8000/mcp`, and that this path is the better fit for production reliability, performance, multiple workers, custom middleware, and existing deployment pipelines. ([FastMCP][3])

### 19.4 `run_http_async()` and serve-time knobs

The transport SDK exposes a more explicit HTTP runtime surface through `run_http_async(...)`, with `transport`, `host`, `port`, `path`, `uvicorn_config`, `middleware`, `json_response`, and `stateless_http`. This is the “serve-time binding” counterpart to the constructor and is where transport-specific choices belong. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="kuhb1v"
await mcp.run_http_async(
    transport="http",
    host="0.0.0.0",
    port=8000,
    path="/api/mcp/",
    stateless_http=True,
)
```

Two agent-useful implications follow from the SDK signature. First, runtime transport choice is orthogonal to server construction; do not push host/port/path back into `FastMCP(...)`. Second, `stateless_http`, ASGI `middleware`, and endpoint `path` are deployment-time concerns that should remain environment-specific unless the deployment shape is itself part of the product contract. ([FastMCP][1])

### 19.5 Path semantics: `/mcp/` defaults, custom paths, and mount composition

The HTTP deployment guide says the default MCP HTTP endpoint is `/mcp/`, and both `run()` and `http_app()` accept `path=` to change it, for example to `/api/mcp/`. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="4es3km"
# Direct server
mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, path="/api/mcp/")

# ASGI export
app = mcp.http_app(path="/api/mcp/")
```

That changes the externally reachable endpoint to `http://localhost:8000/api/mcp/`. Use this when the MCP endpoint path itself is part of the deployment contract. ([FastMCP][3])

When mounting into another ASGI app, path composition becomes two-level:

* **mount prefix** from the parent ASGI router
* **internal MCP path** from `http_app(path=...)`

The docs show both patterns:

1. `mcp.http_app(path="/mcp")` mounted at `/analytics` gives `/analytics/mcp/`.
2. `mcp.http_app(path="/")` mounted at `/mcp` gives `/mcp`. ([FastMCP][4])

That distinction matters because many incorrect generated deployments accidentally double-prefix the MCP route. ([FastMCP][3])

### 19.6 Starlette mounting

The HTTP deployment guide documents Starlette mounting directly:

```python id="jcv79k"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def analyze(data: str) -> dict:
    return {"result": f"Analyzed: {data}"}

mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path="/mcp")

app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount("/mcp-server", app=mcp_app),
    ],
    lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan,
)
```

The resulting MCP endpoint is `/mcp-server/mcp/`. The same page is explicit that for Streamable HTTP, you must pass the FastMCP lifespan into the parent Starlette app because nested lifespans are not recognized; otherwise the session manager will not initialize correctly. This is a correctness requirement, not a convenience. ([FastMCP][3])

### 19.7 FastAPI mounting

The FastAPI integration guide gives the equivalent pattern:

```python id="2q42ow"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastapi import FastAPI

mcp = FastMCP("Analytics Tools")

@mcp.tool
def analyze_pricing(category: str) -> dict:
    return {"category": category}

mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path="/mcp")
app = FastAPI(title="E-commerce API", lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan)
app.mount("/analytics", mcp_app)
```

The documented result is MCP at `/analytics/mcp/`. The same guide later gives the “path already owned by mount” variant:

```python id="sokuqt"
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path="/")
app = FastAPI(lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan)
app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)   # endpoint: /mcp
```

The guide is explicit that omitting `lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan` is incorrect because the session manager will not initialize. ([FastMCP][4])

If the FastAPI application already has its own lifespan, the lifespans page recommends `combine_lifespans(...)` so both the FastAPI app and the FastMCP sub-app run their startup/shutdown logic. ([FastMCP][5])

```python id="1u3bgs"
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.utilities.lifespan import combine_lifespans

@asynccontextmanager
async def app_lifespan(app):
    yield

mcp = FastMCP("Tools")
mcp_app = mcp.http_app()

app = FastAPI(lifespan=combine_lifespans(app_lifespan, mcp_app.lifespan))
app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)
```

### 19.8 Mounted OAuth-protected servers: `.well-known`, `base_url`, and `mcp_path`

This is the highest-value deployment subtlety in the HTTP docs. When an OAuth-protected FastMCP server is mounted under a path prefix, operational routes and discovery routes obey different rules. The deployment guide says OAuth operational routes move with the mount, but discovery routes must remain at the domain root for RFC compliance. Specifically, operational routes include `/authorize`, `/token`, `/auth/callback`, and `/mcp`; discovery routes include `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/*`. ([FastMCP][3])

The guide states the two most common mistakes explicitly:

1. forgetting to mount `.well-known` routes at the root level when the server is mounted under a prefix;
2. including the mount prefix in both `base_url` and `mcp_path`, which yields doubled paths like `/api/api/mcp`. ([FastMCP][3])

The parameter contract is:

* `base_url` includes the external mount prefix, for example `http://localhost:8000/api`
* `mcp_path` is only the internal MCP route, for example `/mcp`
* `issuer_url` is optional and defaults to `base_url`
* key invariant: **`base_url + mcp_path = actual externally accessible MCP URL`** ([FastMCP][3])

That means:

* correct: `base_url="http://localhost:8000/api"` and `mcp_path="/mcp"` → final endpoint `/api/mcp`
* wrong: `base_url="http://localhost:8000/api"` and `mcp_path="/api/mcp"` → final endpoint `/api/api/mcp` ([FastMCP][3])

The deployment guide’s canonical mounted-OAuth pattern is:

```python id="5hvyne"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount

ROOT_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
MOUNT_PREFIX = "/api"
MCP_PATH = "/mcp"

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    base_url=f"{ROOT_URL}{MOUNT_PREFIX}",
)

mcp = FastMCP("Protected Server", auth=auth)
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path=MCP_PATH)

well_known_routes = auth.get_well_known_routes(mcp_path=MCP_PATH)

app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        *well_known_routes,                 # root-level discovery
        Mount(MOUNT_PREFIX, app=mcp_app),  # prefixed operational routes
    ],
    lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan,
)
```

The documented resulting URL set is:

* MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/mcp`
* OAuth authorization: `http://localhost:8000/api/authorize`
* OAuth callback: `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/callback`
* Authorization-server metadata: `http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/api`
* Protected-resource metadata: `http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/mcp` ([FastMCP][3])

A second subtlety: when `issuer_url` has a path, or when it defaults from a path-bearing `base_url`, FastMCP generates **path-aware** discovery routes, such as `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/api`. That behavior is intentional and required for the mounted-path OAuth case. ([FastMCP][3])

### 19.9 Horizontal scaling and `stateless_http`

The HTTP deployment guide says Streamable HTTP is stateful by default: server-side sessions are maintained in memory, enabling MCP features such as elicitation and sampling. That is fine for single-instance deployments but problematic for horizontal scaling because requests from one client may land on different instances. The same guide further says sticky sessions are not reliable for many MCP clients because clients such as Cursor and Claude Code use `fetch()` and do not properly forward `Set-Cookie` headers. ([FastMCP][3])

The documented mitigation is `stateless_http=True`, either through `http_app()`, through `run(transport="http", stateless_http=True)`, or through `FASTMCP_STATELESS_HTTP=true`. In stateless mode, each request creates a fresh transport context, eliminating the need for session affinity. If you plan to run multiple Uvicorn workers or multiple hosts behind a load balancer, treat `stateless_http=True` as the default unless you explicitly require stateful MCP session features. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="9ikd0y"
# ASGI
app = mcp.http_app(stateless_http=True)

# direct runtime
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", stateless_http=True)
```

### 19.10 ASGI-only deployment knobs worth knowing

`http_app()` and `run_http_async()` expose a few serve-time knobs that matter for real deployments:

* `middleware=` for ASGI middleware injection
* `json_response=` for response formatting policy
* `event_store=` and `retry_interval=` for resumable long-running event streams
* `stateless_http=` for horizontally scalable deployments
* `path=` for endpoint routing control ([FastMCP][1])

The HTTP deployment guide also notes that for long-running operations with stream reconnection, `http_app(event_store=..., retry_interval=...)` can be backed by in-memory or custom storage, and recommends Redis-backed storage for distributed deployments. That makes `http_app()` the correct primitive when deployment shape, not just functionality, is a design variable. ([FastMCP][3])

### 19.11 Production advisories

**Use STDIO by default for local/editor/desktop/server-subprocess cases.** The docs explicitly position STDIO as perfect for local development, Claude Desktop, command-line tools, and single-user applications. ([FastMCP][2])

**Use `transport="http"` for all new network deployments.** The running guide explicitly recommends HTTP/Streamable HTTP for new network deployments and says SSE should not be used for new projects. ([FastMCP][2])

**Use direct `run(transport="http")` for simple standalone services; use `http_app()` for production infrastructure.** The HTTP deployment guide makes that exact tradeoff: direct runtime for minimal configuration, ASGI for workers, middleware, existing app integration, and deployment-pipeline compatibility. ([FastMCP][3])

**Always wire lifespan when mounting.** Both the Starlette/FastAPI deployment docs and the lifespan docs are explicit that nested lifespans are not recognized automatically; without forwarding `mcp_app.lifespan` (or combining lifespans), FastMCP’s session manager will not initialize correctly. ([FastMCP][3])

**For mounted OAuth-protected servers, root-level `.well-known` routes are mandatory.** FastMCP cannot do this automatically when your protected MCP app is mounted under a prefix; you must retrieve the routes from the auth provider and mount them at the root. ([FastMCP][3])

**Do not duplicate the mount prefix in both `base_url` and `mcp_path`.** The docs call this out as a common mistake and give the exact invariant: `base_url + mcp_path` must equal the externally accessible MCP URL. ([FastMCP][3])

**For multi-worker or load-balanced deployments, default to `stateless_http=True`.** The deployment guide documents why sticky sessions are unreliable with common MCP clients and gives `stateless_http` as the intended solution. ([FastMCP][3])

**If you reverse-proxy Streamable HTTP behind nginx, disable buffering.** The deployment guide states that Streamable HTTP uses Server-Sent Events for streaming responses and gives an nginx example with `proxy_buffering off`, `proxy_cache off`, and extended read/send timeouts to avoid breaking event streams. ([FastMCP][3])

# FastMCP Advanced — 20) HTTP hardening, reverse proxies, scaling, and event delivery


**FastMCP 4 status.** Modern requests are intrinsically replica-friendly because they are self-contained. Application state that spans requests must use explicit session state or durable stores. Gateway infrastructure can use modern MCP method/name routing metadata rather than JSON-RPC body inspection where supported.

## 20.0 HTTP deployment is a systems problem

`mcp.run(transport="http")` is enough to make a network-reachable server, but production correctness depends on much more than opening a port:

```text
external URL / TLS
  -> load balancer / reverse proxy
  -> Host / Origin policy
  -> OAuth discovery + callback URLs
  -> FastMCP ASGI app
  -> stateful or stateless HTTP behavior
  -> session/event/state stores
  -> workers / replicas
  -> backend services
```

The deployment must preserve MCP streaming semantics, auth metadata routes, request identity, lifecycle, and any state expectations. ([HTTP Deployment][1])

---

## 20.1 Direct HTTP vs ASGI export

Direct:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(
        transport="http",
        host="0.0.0.0",
        port=8000,
    )
```

ASGI export:

```python
app = mcp.http_app(path="/mcp")
```

Prefer direct HTTP for simple standalone deployments. Prefer ASGI export when you need:

* multiple workers/process manager control;
* custom ASGI middleware;
* FastAPI/Starlette integration;
* shared web routes;
* external server configuration;
* advanced reverse-proxy deployment. ([HTTP Deployment][1])

---

## 20.2 Path composition invariant

Final MCP URL is composed from the outer mount prefix and the internal FastMCP path.

Example:

```python
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path="/mcp")
app.mount("/analytics", mcp_app)
```

Final path:

```text
/analytics/mcp
```

Alternative:

```python
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path="/")
app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)
```

Final path:

```text
/mcp
```

Write the final external endpoint explicitly in deployment configuration/tests; do not infer it informally from one code line.

---

## 20.3 Lifespan forwarding

For mounted apps:

```python
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path="/mcp")
app = FastAPI(lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan)
app.mount("/analytics", mcp_app)
```

If the outer app already has lifespan behavior, combine lifespans. Without FastMCP's lifecycle, session management and other startup resources can fail. ([FastAPI Integration][2])

---

## 20.4 Stateful HTTP in FastMCP 3

FastMCP 3's Streamable HTTP can maintain server-side MCP session state. This supports 3.x connection/session features but creates a routing problem when multiple workers/replicas are used.

```text
client session -> worker A state
next request -> worker B
              -> state unavailable unless shared/routed
```

Do not add multiple workers to a previously single-process stateful deployment without testing this boundary.

---

## 20.5 `stateless_http=True`

When session-affinity features are not required, use stateless HTTP to make ordinary load balancing practical:

```python
app = mcp.http_app(stateless_http=True)
```

or:

```python
mcp.run(
    transport="http",
    stateless_http=True,
)
```

FastMCP's HTTP guide recommends this for horizontally scaled deployments where MCP session affinity cannot be relied on. ([HTTP Deployment][1])

---

## 20.6 Sticky sessions are not a universal solution

Do not assume cookie-based sticky sessions work with every MCP host. Some hosts use fetch/client behavior that does not preserve proxy cookies as a browser would.

If stateful protocol sessions are mandatory:

* verify the actual MCP session header behavior;
* use shared stores where supported;
* route based on protocol/session identifiers if infrastructure allows;
* test the specific clients you support.

If stateful features are unnecessary, stateless HTTP is simpler.

---

## 20.7 Reverse proxy streaming configuration

Streamable HTTP uses streaming responses. Reverse proxies must not buffer the response until completion.

Typical nginx concepts:

```nginx
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_buffering off;
proxy_cache off;
proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
```

Exact TLS/header/timeouts depend on your infrastructure. The key invariant is: **do not transform a streaming MCP response into a buffered request/response blob**. ([HTTP Deployment][1])

---

## 20.8 Proxy timeout layering

There may be several timeout layers:

```text
client request timeout
reverse proxy timeout
ASGI server timeout
FastMCP tool timeout
backend API timeout
load balancer idle timeout
```

The smallest relevant timeout wins. For long-running work, use background tasks rather than setting every network timeout to hours.

---

## 20.9 Host/Origin protection

FastMCP 3.4.3 introduced Host/Origin validation for DNS-rebinding protection; 3.4.4 restored compatibility by making strict protection opt-in for deployments whose public host/origin is known.

A hardened deployment can explicitly configure concepts such as:

```text
host_origin_protection=True
allowed_hosts=[...]
allowed_origins=[...]
```

Use the exact FastMCP 4 API/configuration location documented by your pinned runtime. Test the public Host header as seen **after** any reverse proxy. ([FastMCP Updates][3])

---

## 20.10 DNS rebinding threat model

Binding to localhost does not automatically make an HTTP MCP endpoint safe from browser-origin attacks.

Threat shape:

```text
malicious web origin
   -> DNS response / rebinding trick
   -> browser sends request toward localhost service
   -> weak Host/Origin validation accepts it
```

Mitigations include Host/Origin validation, authentication, browser-origin policy, and not exposing unnecessary unauthenticated local network services.

---

## 20.11 OAuth mounted-path invariant

For an authenticated server mounted under `/api`:

```text
base_url = https://example.com/api
mcp_path = /mcp
final endpoint = https://example.com/api/mcp
```

Do not set:

```text
base_url = https://example.com/api
mcp_path = /api/mcp
```

which double-applies the prefix. FastMCP's HTTP docs explicitly call out the invariant:

```text
base_url + mcp_path = externally reachable MCP endpoint
```

([HTTP Deployment][1])

---

## 20.12 `.well-known` discovery routes

OAuth discovery metadata has standards-defined root-level routing semantics. When mounting an authenticated FastMCP application under a prefix, the operational routes may move with the application but `.well-known` discovery routes may need explicit root-level mounting.

Conceptual:

```text
/.well-known/...                 -> discovery metadata
/api/authorize                   -> mounted operational route
/api/token                       -> mounted operational route
/api/mcp                         -> mounted MCP endpoint
```

Do not hide `.well-known` metadata under a nested ASGI mount and assume OAuth clients will discover it. ([HTTP Deployment][1])

---

## 20.13 External URL awareness behind proxies

OAuth redirects and metadata must describe the **external** scheme/host/path, not the internal Uvicorn address.

Internal:

```text
http://10.0.2.17:8000/mcp
```

External:

```text
https://mcp.example.com/api/mcp
```

Configure trusted forwarded headers/proxy behavior carefully so the application does not trust spoofed `X-Forwarded-*` values from arbitrary clients.

---

## 20.14 Event stores

FastMCP's ASGI/runtime APIs expose an event-store concept for resumable streaming/event delivery. Use an external/shared event store when continuity must survive worker changes or reconnects.

Design questions:

* event ID uniqueness;
* retention/TTL;
* replay ordering;
* consumer/session isolation;
* backend failure behavior;
* cross-replica consistency;
* cleanup and maximum storage.

In-memory event storage is appropriate only when process-local continuity is acceptable. ([HTTP Deployment][1])

---

## 20.15 Retry interval and reconnect behavior

If an event-store/retry mechanism is enabled, treat retry intervals as client/network behavior, not task polling. A reconnecting stream must resume without duplicating side effects.

Tool execution should be idempotent or separately deduplicated where a network retry could otherwise cause duplicate work.

---

## 20.16 Multiple Uvicorn workers

Before enabling:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --workers 4
```

verify:

```text
[ ] stateless_http or compatible shared session strategy
[ ] shared session state store if session state is used
[ ] shared task backend if workers execute/observe tasks
[ ] external/shared event store if resume requires it
[ ] no correctness-critical module-global mutable state
[ ] every worker can access identical provider/config/catalog sources
[ ] OAuth redirect/base URL not worker-local
```

Process count is an architecture change, not merely a throughput tuning flag.

---

## 20.17 Load balancer health checks

Use a simple HTTP health route for process/load-balancer checks, but also implement deeper readiness checks for systems that rely on upstream MCP providers/databases.

Examples:

```text
/livez   -> process/event loop alive
/readyz  -> required dependencies initialized
```

A ProxyProvider gateway can be "alive" while all upstream MCP servers are unreachable; readiness should reflect the service contract you promise.

---

## 20.18 Custom routes

FastMCP can add lightweight HTTP custom routes such as health checks:

```python
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse


@mcp.custom_route("/health", methods=["GET"])
async def health(request: Request):
    return JSONResponse({"status": "ok"})
```

Use an actual FastAPI/Starlette parent app for complex REST/web functionality; custom routes are not meant to turn FastMCP into a full general web framework. ([Server][4])

---

## 20.19 TLS termination

Production HTTP MCP endpoints should generally use HTTPS. TLS can terminate at:

* cloud load balancer;
* ingress/reverse proxy;
* ASGI server directly.

If TLS terminates upstream, ensure OAuth metadata/redirect URLs still use `https://` externally and that trusted-proxy configuration accurately reconstructs the public request.

---

## 20.20 SSRF-safe auth metadata/JWKS networking

FastMCP 3.4.x hardened OAuth metadata/JWKS fetching and added support for trusted corporate proxies. Do not bypass these protections with a custom generic network fetcher that follows arbitrary redirects or directly accesses private IP ranges.

If enterprise egress requires a proxy, configure it explicitly and fail closed when the security policy requires it. ([FastMCP Updates][3])

---

## 20.21 Container deployment pattern

Conceptual Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN pip install uv && uv sync --frozen --no-dev

COPY src ./src
COPY fastmcp.json ./fastmcp.json

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uv", "run", "fastmcp", "run", "fastmcp.json", "--transport", "http", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Treat the exact CLI options as versioned; an ASGI module plus `uvicorn` may be preferable when using multiple workers or custom middleware.

---

## 20.22 Serverless suitability

Stateless HTTP helps serverless/container-autoscaling deployments, but evaluate:

* cold-start cost of imports/providers;
* lifespan initialization latency;
* external state/task backends;
* maximum request duration;
* streaming support of the platform;
* OAuth callback stability;
* filesystem ephemerality;
* connection/reconnect behavior.

A serverless platform that buffers streaming responses may be incompatible even if normal JSON HTTP works.

---

## 20.23 HTTP hardening matrix

| Concern | Single local HTTP | Internal service | Public multi-replica |
|---|---|---|---|
| TLS | optional dev | usually yes | yes |
| auth | depends | usually | yes |
| Host/Origin policy | recommended | explicit | explicit |
| stateless HTTP | optional | evaluate | usually prefer unless session features required |
| shared session store | no | if stateful multi-worker | if stateful |
| event store | optional | if resumability needed | shared if resumability needed |
| reverse-proxy buffering | n/a | disable for streaming | disable |
| `.well-known` root routes | if OAuth | if OAuth | if OAuth |
| SSRF/trusted proxy | auth-provider dependent | likely | required review |

---

## 20.24 Failure-mode diagnostics

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| works locally, 404 behind ingress | mount prefix/internal path |
| OAuth discovery fails | `.well-known` routing / external base URL |
| redirect returns wrong host/scheme | forwarded headers/public URL config |
| intermittent session failures with workers | stateful HTTP routed across workers |

## 20.25 Anti-pattern inventory

* adding workers without evaluating stateful session behavior;
* assuming sticky cookies work with every MCP client;
* enabling proxy buffering for Streamable HTTP;
* using internal Uvicorn URL as OAuth public `base_url`;
* nesting `.well-known` routes under an arbitrary mount prefix;
* duplicating mount prefix in both `base_url` and `mcp_path`;
* trusting forwarded headers from any source;
* disabling Host/Origin protections because one proxy was misconfigured instead of fixing the public host model;
* custom OAuth metadata fetches that bypass SSRF defenses;
* health checks that ignore required upstream MCP providers;
* putting long-running work in foreground requests and simply increasing all timeouts.

---

## 20.26 HTTP deployment checklist

```text
[ ] Record exact external MCP URL.
[ ] Verify mount prefix + internal MCP path composition.
[ ] Forward/combine FastMCP lifespan.
[ ] Decide stateful vs stateless HTTP explicitly.
[ ] If multi-worker, externalize required state/task/event stores.
[ ] Disable reverse-proxy buffering for streaming.
[ ] Set coherent timeout budgets across every network layer.
[ ] Configure public base_url / OAuth callback metadata.
[ ] Mount required .well-known routes correctly.
[ ] Configure Host/Origin policy for known public endpoints.
[ ] Preserve SSRF-safe auth metadata/JWKS fetching.
[ ] Test through the real load balancer/reverse proxy, not only localhost.

# FastMCP Advanced — 21) Programmatic client fundamentals
### Programmatic client fundamentals

**FastMCP 4 status.** `Client(..., mode="auto")` negotiates the best mutual protocol era by default. `ping()` is not routed on the modern sessionless era. Response caching and multi-round input driving are now part of client concerns.


### 21.0 Role and operating model

`fastmcp.Client` is a **deterministic, explicit, programmatic** MCP client. The docs position it as a typed building block for controlled interactions rather than an autonomous agent runtime: you call explicit methods, manage connection scope deliberately, and receive typed result objects instead of conversational side effects. Internally, the `Client` owns MCP protocol logic while a `Transport` owns connection establishment and lifecycle. ([FastMCP][1])

The client is also designed for **reentrant** usage. The SDK says it supports multiple concurrent or nested `async with client:` blocks via reference counting and background session management, specifically to avoid race conditions exposed by MCP SDK behavior such as automatic `list_tools()` calls during tool execution. That means “use `async with` everywhere” and “reuse one configured client safely in nested code paths” are compatible design choices. ([FastMCP][2])

### 21.1 Constructor surface and transport inference

The `Client` constructor accepts a **transport/source specification** plus optional handlers and timeouts. The SDK documents the accepted source categories as: a `ClientTransport` instance, an in-process `FastMCP` server, a URL / `str`, a `Path`, an `MCPConfig`, or a configuration `dict`; optional constructor concerns include roots, sampling/log/message/progress handlers, request timeout, and initialization timeout. ([FastMCP][2])

FastMCP automatically infers the concrete transport from what you pass. The transport-inference SDK is explicit:

* `FastMCP` instance → in-memory transport
* file path (`Path` or `str`) → Python STDIO transport for `.py`, Node STDIO transport for `.js`
* URL (`AnyUrl` or `str`) → `StreamableHttpTransport` by default, or `SSETransport` for `/sse` endpoints
* `MCPConfig` / config `dict` → `MCPConfigTransport`, potentially creating a composite multi-server client. ([FastMCP][3])

Representative forms:

```python id="7u4lbo"
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

server = FastMCP("TestServer")

client_a = Client(server)                       # in-memory
client_b = Client("https://example.com/mcp")   # HTTP
client_c = Client(Path("my_server.py"))              # inferred STDIO
client_d = Client({
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {"url": "https://weather.example.com/mcp"},
        "assistant": {"command": "python", "args": ["./assistant.py"]},
    }
})
```

That source-inference behavior is the core reason the client feels compact at call sites while still supporting very different deployment topologies. ([FastMCP][1])

### 21.2 `async with` lifecycle, connection establishment, and initialization

The high-level client docs are explicit: all client operations should run inside `async with client:` so connection setup and teardown happen correctly. Entering the context establishes the transport connection and performs the MCP initialization handshake automatically unless `auto_initialize=False` was configured. The handshake exchanges capabilities, server metadata, protocol version, and optional server instructions. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="lymwxz"
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer", instructions="Use the greet tool to say hello!")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

async def main():
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        await client.ping()
        print(client.initialize_result.server_info.name)
        print(client.initialize_result.instructions)

asyncio.run(main())
```

The SDK also documents manual initialization for advanced cases. `initialize(timeout=...)` is idempotent, returns the cached first result on repeated calls, and is only necessary when `auto_initialize=False` was set during client construction. This is the right pattern when you need to connect first, inspect connection state, or customize initialization timing separately from ordinary operations. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="aa84mu"
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client(Path("my_server.py"), auto_initialize=False)

async with client:
    assert client.is_connected()
    assert client.initialize_result is None

    init = await client.initialize(timeout=10.0)
    print(init.server_info.name)

    tools = await client.list_tools()
```

### 21.3 Transport choice and deployment implications

#### In-memory transport

Passing a `FastMCP` instance creates an in-memory transport. The docs describe this as direct same-process interaction with no subprocess or network overhead, sharing the same memory space and environment variables as the client process. This is the best transport for testing, local evaluation harnesses, and deterministic integration tests. ([FastMCP][1])

#### STDIO transport

Passing a local script path infers STDIO transport, but the transport docs warn that this is the **limited** convenience path. For full control, instantiate `StdioTransport` explicitly with `command`, `args`, `env`, and `cwd`. The key operational rule is explicit in the docs: STDIO servers **do not inherit** your shell environment by default, so required environment variables must be passed intentionally. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="eh9bej"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StdioTransport

transport = StdioTransport(
    command="python",
    args=["my_server.py", "--verbose"],
    env={"API_KEY": "secret", "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"},
    cwd="/path/to/server",
)

client = Client(transport)
```

STDIO also supports subprocess session persistence by default (`keep_alive=True`), so repeated `async with client:` blocks can reuse the same subprocess. Disable that explicitly when you need per-connection isolation. ([FastMCP][4])

#### HTTP transport

HTTP is the recommended production transport. The docs describe it as the right fit when the server runs independently and manages its own lifecycle. The explicit transport class is `StreamableHttpTransport`, and you can configure headers, auth, and SSL verification through either the transport or the `Client(...)` constructor. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="qlzodt"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

transport = StreamableHttpTransport(
    url="https://api.example.com/mcp",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here"},
)

client = Client(transport)
```

The transport docs also show constructor-level TLS controls such as `verify=False`, custom CA bundle paths, or custom `ssl.SSLContext` objects. Those are deployment-time controls, not protocol concerns, and belong in the client configuration when talking to internal or self-signed HTTPS endpoints. ([FastMCP][4])

#### SSE transport

SSE remains supported for backward compatibility, but the current client transport docs explicitly recommend Streamable HTTP for new deployments unless you have specific infrastructure reasons to stay on SSE. That makes SSE a compatibility transport, not a new-default design target. ([FastMCP][4])

#### MCPConfig / multi-server composition

If you pass an `MCPConfig` or config `dict`, `Client(...)` can connect to one or more servers. The config-transport SDK says a single-server config becomes a direct transport; a multi-server config becomes a composite client by mounting the servers behind one interface, with tool names prefixed as `{server_name}_{tool_name}` and resource URIs prefixed as `protocol://{server_name}/path`. ([FastMCP][3])

### 21.4 Connection-state helpers and session reuse

The SDK exposes a few state/lifecycle helpers that matter in advanced client code:

* `is_connected()` tells you whether the transport/session is currently active
* `initialize_result` holds the cached MCP initialization response
* `session` returns the active low-level session and raises if disconnected
* `new()` clones the client configuration but gives you fresh disconnected session state. ([FastMCP][2])

`new()` is the correct primitive when you want the same transport/auth/handler configuration but need an independent session—for example, parallel evaluations that should not share roots, state, or handshake context. ([FastMCP][2])

### 21.5 `ping()` — lowest-friction liveness check

`ping()` is the simplest connectivity primitive. The SDK defines it as `ping(self) -> bool` and the high-level client docs show it as the first operation typically issued after entering the client context. Use it for liveness checks, quick smoke tests, or session validation before more expensive operations. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="4u1rwi"
async with client:
    ok = await client.ping()
    assert ok
```

### 21.6 Listing operations: `list_tools()`, `list_resources()`, `list_prompts()`

The client exposes three primary listing methods:

* `list_tools(...) -> list[mcp.types.Tool]`
* `list_resources(...) -> list[mcp.types.Resource]`
* `list_prompts(...) -> list[mcp.types.Prompt]`

The SDK mixins state that all three automatically paginate through all result pages by default, up to `max_pages=250`, and raise if the page limit is exceeded before pagination completes. For manual pagination control or access to raw protocol metadata, use the corresponding `*_mcp()` methods instead. ([FastMCP][5])

```python id="0qbgdr"
async with client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    prompts = await client.list_prompts()
```

This distinction—high-level convenience list vs raw protocol list—is fundamental:

* `list_tools_mcp()` returns `mcp.types.ListToolsResult`
* `list_resources_mcp()` returns `mcp.types.ListResourcesResult`
* `list_prompts_mcp()` returns `mcp.types.ListPromptsResult`

Use the raw forms when you need cursors or complete protocol payloads; use the convenience forms when you want the fully collected catalog immediately. ([FastMCP][6])

One subtlety on the resource side: concrete resources and resource templates are listed separately. `list_resources()` returns `Resource` objects; `list_resource_templates()` returns `ResourceTemplate` objects. `read_resource(...)` can resolve either a concrete resource URI or a filled-in template URI, but discovery is split across the two listing methods. ([FastMCP][5])

### 21.7 `call_tool(...)` — executable operation with typed result hydration

`call_tool(...)` is the client’s imperative operation entrypoint. The tools mixin SDK documents the current effective surface as: tool `name`, optional `arguments`, optional `version`, optional `timeout`, optional `progress_handler`, optional `raise_on_error`, optional request `meta`, and optional task controls (`task`, `task_id`, `ttl`). The raw-protocol twin `call_tool_mcp(...)` returns the underlying `mcp.types.CallToolResult` and does **not** raise on tool-level failure. ([FastMCP][6])

Basic usage:

```python id="fi1v9g"
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 5, "b": 3})
```

The high-level client docs define the return as `CallToolResult` and spell out its core properties:

* `.data`: FastMCP-only hydrated Python value reconstructed from the server’s output schema
* `.content`: standard MCP content blocks (`TextContent`, `ImageContent`, `AudioContent`, etc.)
* `.structured_content`: raw structured JSON payload from the server
* `.is_error`: boolean tool-failure marker. ([FastMCP][7])

This yields the single most important result-model distinction in the whole client API:

* use `.data` when you want **deserialized Python objects** with complex types restored;
* use `.structured_content` when you want the **raw JSON structure** exactly as sent;
* use `.content` when you want the **protocol-standard content blocks** suitable for text/media handling. ([FastMCP][7])

Representative access pattern:

```python id="e8jcmz"
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool("get_weather", {"city": "London"})

    python_value = result.data
    raw_json = result.structured_content
    first_block = result.content[0]
```

The docs also state an important fallback rule: if the tool has no output schema, or deserialization fails, `.data` will be `None`; in that case fall back to `.content`. Primitive tool outputs are automatically wrapped on the server as `{"result": value}` and unwrapped by FastMCP on the client so `.data` is the original primitive. ([FastMCP][7])

Error behavior is also explicit. `call_tool()` raises `ToolError` by default when the server reports tool failure; `raise_on_error=False` disables that and lets you inspect `.is_error` and `.content` manually. If you need the raw MCP result object with `isError` and no client-side exception behavior, use `call_tool_mcp(...)` instead. ([FastMCP][7])

```python id="i0okek"
from fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

async with client:
    try:
        result = await client.call_tool("potentially_failing_tool", {"param": "value"})
    except ToolError:
        ...

    raw = await client.call_tool_mcp("potentially_failing_tool", {"param": "value"})
    if raw.is_error:
        ...
```

### 21.8 `read_resource(...)` — URI-addressed content retrieval

`read_resource(...)` is the resource-side read primitive. The resources mixin SDK documents the effective surface as: `uri`, optional `version`, optional request `meta`, and optional task controls (`task`, `task_id`, `ttl`). The raw twin `read_resource_mcp(...)` returns `mcp.types.ReadResourceResult`; the convenience form returns either a content list or a `ResourceTask` when background execution is requested. ([FastMCP][5])

Basic read:

```python id="6vh7m7"
async with client:
    content = await client.read_resource("file:///path/to/README.md")
```

The high-level resource docs say the return is a list of `TextResourceContents | BlobResourceContents`. Text items expose `.text` and `.mimeType`; binary items expose `.blob` and `.mimeType`. Resource templates are read through the same method by supplying a concrete filled-in URI like `weather://london/current`. ([FastMCP][8])

```python id="jlwmfs"
async with client:
    content = await client.read_resource("resource://config/settings.json")
    if hasattr(content[0], "text"):
        print(content[0].text)
        print(content[0].mimeType)

    binary = await client.read_resource("resource://images/logo.png")
    if hasattr(binary[0], "blob"):
        print(len(binary[0].blob))
        print(binary[0].mimeType)
```

This is the key result-model difference from tools: `read_resource(...)` does **not** return a `.data`-bearing hydration object. Its primary abstraction is the content-item list itself, with `.text`/`.blob` on each element. If you want a typed Python object from resource data, that is your responsibility after reading the textual or binary content. ([FastMCP][8])

### 21.9 `get_prompt(...)` — rendered message retrieval

`get_prompt(...)` retrieves a rendered prompt result from the server. The prompts mixin SDK documents the effective surface as: prompt `name`, optional `arguments`, optional `version`, optional request `meta`, and optional task controls (`task`, `task_id`, `ttl`). The raw and convenience forms are `get_prompt_mcp(...)` and `get_prompt(...)`; both return a `GetPromptResult` when not using background execution. ([FastMCP][9])

Basic usage:

```python id="hlx5p3"
async with client:
    result = await client.get_prompt("welcome_message")
    for message in result.messages:
        print(message.role, message.content)
```

The client prompt docs explicitly say `get_prompt()` returns `mcp.types.GetPromptResult`, and that the meaningful payload is `result.messages`. Each rendered message has a `role` and `content`; the docs show content access either directly or via `.content.text` when the content object is text-shaped. ([FastMCP][10])

This is the fundamental contrast with tools/resources:

* tool call → one `CallToolResult` with `.data`, `.content`, `.structured_content`
* resource read → list of resource-content items with `.text` / `.blob`
* prompt render → `GetPromptResult` whose main payload is `.messages`. ([FastMCP][7])

Prompt arguments also have a special serialization rule. The current prompt client docs say FastMCP automatically serializes complex prompt arguments to JSON strings as required by MCP, so you can pass dataclasses, dicts, and lists directly from Python and the client will encode them appropriately before sending the request. ([FastMCP][10])

```python id="7nriay"
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class UserData:
    name: str
    age: int

async with client:
    result = await client.get_prompt("analyze_user", {
        "user": UserData(name="Alice", age=30),
        "preferences": {"theme": "dark"},
        "scores": [85, 92, 78],
    })
```

### 21.10 `.data` vs `.content` vs rendered prompt messages

This distinction is worth stating as a standalone contract:

For **tool calls**, `.data` is the FastMCP-specific typed/hydrated Python value reconstructed from output schema, `.structured_content` is the raw structured JSON, and `.content` is the protocol-standard content-block list. When no output schema exists or hydration fails, `.data` is `None`, but `.content` still exists. ([FastMCP][7])

For **resource reads**, there is no `.data` abstraction. The result is the content list itself, and each item is either text-like (`.text`) or binary-like (`.blob`), with `.mimeType` to guide interpretation. ([FastMCP][8])

For **prompt renders**, the meaningful result is the rendered conversation/message sequence in `GetPromptResult.messages`; each message carries `role` and `content`. Prompt rendering is therefore message-first, not data-first and not content-block-first in the same way tools are. ([FastMCP][10])

A practical rule follows: if you want typed Python data back, prefer tool calls with output schemas. If you want passive text/blob payloads addressed by URI, use resources. If you want reusable rendered conversational scaffolding, use prompts. The client API mirrors those three server component roles directly. ([FastMCP][1])

### 21.11 Raw protocol access vs convenience methods

Each major operation has a raw-protocol twin:

* `call_tool_mcp(...) -> mcp.types.CallToolResult`
* `read_resource_mcp(...) -> mcp.types.ReadResourceResult`
* `get_prompt_mcp(...) -> mcp.types.GetPromptResult`
* plus `list_*_mcp()` methods for full paginated list results. ([FastMCP][6])

Use the convenience methods when you want automatic pagination, automatic prompt-argument serialization, typed tool-result hydration, and default exception behavior. Use the raw MCP methods when you need the wire-level response object, cursor metadata, raw `isError` handling, or you are building a higher-level client abstraction that should control deserialization and error policy itself. ([FastMCP][7])

### 21.12 Deployment and authoring advisories

Use **in-memory** transport for tests and same-process evaluation harnesses; use **STDIO** when the client should launch a local server subprocess; use **HTTP / Streamable HTTP** for production services; use **SSE** only for backward compatibility with older deployments or clients. The transport docs are explicit about each of those recommendations. ([FastMCP][4])

Do not rely on file-path inference for anything beyond the simplest local usage. The docs explicitly say it is a convenience path with limited configuration, whereas explicit `StdioTransport(...)` lets you set command, args, environment, and working directory. That is especially important because STDIO servers do **not** inherit your shell environment by default. ([FastMCP][4])

Use `async with client:` as the default lifecycle shape everywhere, even though the client supports reentrant contexts. That gives you correct connection management, automatic initialization, and a predictable cleanup boundary; drop to manual `initialize()` only when you explicitly need deferred handshake control. ([FastMCP][1])

If you need isolated sessions with the same configuration, use `client.new()` rather than mutating one shared client instance unpredictably. If you need transport-specific control—headers, auth, SSL verification, env, or keep-alive—instantiate the transport explicitly rather than relying on inference. ([FastMCP][2])

# FastMCP Advanced — 22) Client transports, handlers, roots, and client-side auth
### Client transports, handlers, roots, and client-side auth

**FastMCP 4 status.** Client sampling/roots handlers still matter: they can serve legacy pushed requests and modern returned input requests. Server-side `ctx.sample`/`ctx.list_roots` are removed. Use `Path` for local-script transport inference and `mode=` to control protocol negotiation.


### 22.0 Scope and constructor surface

`Client(...)` is transport-driven. The SDK documents the constructor as accepting a connection source plus client-side runtime hooks: `transport`/source, `roots`, `sampling_handler`, `log_handler`, `message_handler`, `progress_handler`, `timeout`, and `init_timeout`. The source can be a concrete transport instance, a `FastMCP` server, a URL/string, a local path, an `MCPConfig`, or a configuration dict. This means “transport selection” and “interactive capability callbacks” are both first-class constructor concerns, not later bolt-ons. ([FastMCP][1])

At a design level, the client should be configured around three orthogonal axes: **transport** (how to connect), **auth** (how to authenticate over HTTP transports), and **handlers/roots** (how the client responds when the server calls back into it for sampling, elicitation, progress, logging, notifications, or root discovery). Keeping those axes separate avoids one of the most common generated-code mistakes: mixing transport wiring, OAuth state, and user-interaction callbacks in ad hoc request code instead of at client construction time. ([FastMCP][1])

### 22.1 Transport inference vs explicit transport objects

FastMCP can infer transports from what you pass to `Client(...)`: a `FastMCP` instance gives in-memory transport, a file path gives STDIO, a URL gives HTTP or SSE depending on the path, and a config object/dict can produce single-server or composite multi-server transports. The docs repeatedly note that explicit transport instances give full control over configuration, while inference is mainly a convenience layer. ([FastMCP][2])

The practical rule for agent authors is:

* use **explicit transport objects** in production or any nontrivial local setup;
* use **inference** only for quick tests, examples, or one-off scripts. ([FastMCP][3])

---

## 22.2 `StdioTransport` — subprocess-controlled local transport

STDIO transport communicates with servers through subprocess pipes. The client launches and manages the server process, controlling its lifecycle and environment. FastMCP’s docs call this the standard mechanism for local desktop-style MCP use and the right choice when you need a local server process under explicit client control. ([FastMCP][3])

Canonical explicit form:

```python id="ldv6z2"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StdioTransport

transport = StdioTransport(
    command="python",
    args=["my_server.py", "--verbose"],
    env={"API_KEY": "secret", "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"},
    cwd="/path/to/server",
)

client = Client(transport)
```

This shape is directly documented and should be preferred over path inference whenever environment, arguments, or working directory matter. ([FastMCP][3])

### 22.2.1 Critical environment rule: nothing is inherited automatically

The docs are explicit: STDIO servers run in isolated environments by default and do **not** inherit your shell environment variables. You must pass needed configuration explicitly via `env=...`. FastMCP even documents selective forwarding and `.env` loading as the standard patterns for this. ([FastMCP][3])

Selective forwarding pattern:

```python id="e4j8zl"
import os
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StdioTransport

required_vars = ["API_KEY", "DATABASE_URL", "REDIS_HOST"]
env = {var: os.environ[var] for var in required_vars if var in os.environ}

client = Client(
    StdioTransport(
        command="python",
        args=["server.py"],
        env=env,
    )
)
```

For generated deployment code, this should be treated as a hard rule, not a suggestion. “It worked in my shell” is not evidence that it will work under STDIO client launch. ([FastMCP][3])

### 22.2.2 Path inference is intentionally limited

FastMCP 4 deprecates the bare local-script string form. `Client(Path("my_server.py"))` is the convenient local-script form; use explicit `StdioTransport` when you need environment, CWD, interpreter, or subprocess control. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="t3a8di"
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client(Path("my_server.py"))  # Convenient local-script inference
```

### 22.2.3 Session persistence and subprocess reuse

`StdioTransport` defaults to `keep_alive=True`, meaning the same subprocess can be reused across multiple `async with client:` blocks. The docs present this as a performance feature; set `keep_alive=False` when you need isolation between client contexts instead of reuse. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="pi8ruu"
from fastmcp.client.transports import StdioTransport
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client(
    StdioTransport(
        command="python",
        args=["server.py"],
        keep_alive=False,   # fresh subprocess per connection
    )
)
```

Use reuse for local productivity and repeated calls to the same stable subprocess. Disable reuse for tests that require a fresh process boundary, for stateful servers that should not leak state across sessions, or when debugging startup behavior. ([FastMCP][3])

---

## 22.3 `StreamableHttpTransport` — production HTTP transport

FastMCP’s transport docs are explicit: HTTP transport connects to MCP servers running as web services and is the **recommended transport for production deployments**. This is the correct client transport for independently managed remote services, shared team servers, and internet- or intranet-reachable MCP endpoints. ([FastMCP][3])

Canonical explicit form:

```python id="q4tg4w"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

transport = StreamableHttpTransport(
    url="https://api.example.com/mcp",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here",
        "X-Custom-Header": "value",
    },
)

client = Client(transport)
```

This is the default recommendation for new production HTTP clients. Use it unless you have a specific reason to stay on SSE. ([FastMCP][3])

### 22.3.1 TLS / certificate verification

The docs say HTTPS verification is enabled by default and the `verify` parameter accepts the same values as `httpx`: `False`, a CA bundle path, or a custom `ssl.SSLContext`. The same parameter exists on both `StreamableHttpTransport` and `SSETransport`. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="jlwmkl"
import ssl
from fastmcp import Client

client_a = Client("https://dev-server.internal/mcp", verify=False)
client_b = Client("https://corp-server.internal/mcp", verify="/path/to/ca-bundle.pem")

ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.load_verify_locations("/path/to/internal-ca.pem")
client_c = Client("https://corp-server.internal/mcp", verify=ctx)
```

Use `verify=False` only for local development or controlled internal testing. For enterprise/internal deployments, prefer a custom CA bundle or SSL context rather than disabling verification entirely. That is a security recommendation grounded in the documented verification surface. ([FastMCP][3])

---

## 22.4 `SSETransport` — backward-compatibility transport

FastMCP’s client transport docs state plainly that SSE is maintained for backward compatibility and that **Streamable HTTP should be used for new deployments unless specific infrastructure requirements force SSE**. This is one of the clearest transport recommendations in the docs. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="1nnv2v"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import SSETransport

transport = SSETransport(
    url="https://api.example.com/sse",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer token"},
)

client = Client(transport)
```

Use SSE only when you are integrating with an older server/client ecosystem that already depends on it or when surrounding infrastructure explicitly expects SSE rather than Streamable HTTP. Do not choose it as a fresh default. ([FastMCP][3])

---

## 22.5 In-memory client/server connections

Passing a `FastMCP` server instance to `Client(...)` yields an in-memory transport. The client docs call this ideal for testing and development because it eliminates subprocess and network overhead, and—unlike STDIO—the server shares the same memory space and environment variables as the client code. ([FastMCP][2])

```python id="azjjlwm"
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
import os

mcp = FastMCP("TestServer")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    prefix = os.environ.get("GREETING_PREFIX", "Hello")
    return f"{prefix}, {name}!"

client = Client(mcp)
```

Use in-memory transport for tests, benchmarks, local harnesses, and any environment where “same process, no IPC/network” is exactly what you want. Do not mistake it for a production deployment transport; its value is determinism and zero-overhead local integration. ([FastMCP][3])

---

## 22.6 Configuration-based / multi-server transports

FastMCP supports config-driven clients that connect to multiple servers through one `Client(...)`. The transport docs show a configuration dict with `mcpServers`, and the example demonstrates that tool names become namespaced by server (`weather_get_forecast`, `assistant_ask`). This is the correct transport-level composition primitive on the client side. ([FastMCP][3])

```python id="wnq0it"
from fastmcp import Client

config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http",
        },
        "assistant": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["./assistant.py"],
            "env": {"LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"},
        },
    }
}

client = Client(config)
```

Use this when the caller should see a composed client view but you do not want to build a server-side proxy/orchestrator first. The tradeoff is client-side namespacing complexity instead of server-side composition. ([FastMCP][3])

---

## 22.7 Client-side auth overview: transport scope

FastMCP client auth helpers are only meaningful for **HTTP-based transports**. The bearer-auth docs say bearer auth is only relevant for HTTP transports; the OAuth docs say OAuth auth is only relevant for HTTP-based transports and requires browser interaction; the CIMD docs say CIMD is only relevant for HTTP-based transports and requires server support. STDIO and in-memory transports do not use these HTTP auth mechanisms. ([FastMCP][4])

The practical split is:

* **Bearer auth** for non-interactive tokens you already possess
* **OAuth** for interactive user login / consent flows
* **CIMD** as an OAuth enhancement for verifiable client identity on supporting servers. ([FastMCP][4])

---

## 22.8 `auth="<token>"` and `BearerAuth(...)`

FastMCP’s simplest bearer-auth path is to pass the raw token string to `auth=` on `Client(...)` or on an HTTP transport. The docs are explicit that FastMCP will add the `Bearer` scheme automatically, and you should **not** include the `Bearer ` prefix yourself. This is positioned as the best fit for service accounts, long-lived API keys, CI/CD, or applications where authentication is managed elsewhere. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="xn1oxr"
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client(
    "https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp",
    auth="<your-token>",
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

Equivalent transport-level form:

```python id="nl6zwo"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

transport = StreamableHttpTransport(
    "https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp",
    auth="<your-token>",
)

async with Client(transport) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

If you want explicit control instead of implicit string-to-auth conversion, use `BearerAuth(token=...)`. The bearer-auth docs and SDK state that `BearerAuth` implements `httpx.Auth`. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="w4lhsg"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import BearerAuth

async with Client(
    "https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp",
    auth=BearerAuth(token="<your-token>"),
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

If the server expects a non-Bearer header or custom token scheme, the docs recommend bypassing `auth=` entirely and setting headers directly on the transport. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="a0drpc"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

async with Client(
    transport=StreamableHttpTransport(
        "https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp",
        headers={"X-API-Key": "<your-token>"},
    ),
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

### 22.8.1 Bearer-auth guidance

Use raw-string `auth="<token>"` when brevity matters and the standard `Authorization: Bearer ...` scheme is correct. Use `BearerAuth(...)` when you want explicitness or when passing around auth objects. Use custom headers only when the server’s auth contract is non-standard. All three patterns are directly documented. ([FastMCP][4])

---

## 22.9 `auth="oauth"` and `OAuth(...)`

FastMCP’s OAuth client helper is the interactive browser-based path for OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. The docs say OAuth auth is relevant only for HTTP transports, requires user interaction via a web browser, and that the simplest default configuration is `auth="oauth"`. ([FastMCP][5])

```python id="7z0uh6"
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client(
    "https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp",
    auth="oauth",
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

For full control, instantiate `OAuth(...)` and pass it to `auth=` on the client or transport. The docs state that `OAuth` manages the full Authorization Code Grant + PKCE flow and implements `httpx.Auth`. They also state that when `OAuth` is used through `Client(auth=...)`, you do not need to pass `mcp_url`; the transport supplies the server URL automatically. ([FastMCP][5])

```python id="7ocfik"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuth

oauth = OAuth(scopes=["user"])

async with Client(
    "https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp",
    auth=oauth,
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

### 22.9.1 `OAuth(...)` parameters that actually matter

The OAuth docs enumerate the main parameters:

* `scopes`: requested scopes
* `client_name`: name used for dynamic registration
* `client_id`: pre-registered OAuth client ID; when provided, DCR is skipped
* `client_secret`: optional secret for pre-registered clients
* `client_metadata_url`: URL-based client identity for CIMD
* `token_storage`: `AsyncKeyValue` backend for persisted tokens. ([FastMCP][5])

This yields three high-value patterns:

1. **Pure dynamic-registration client**: only `scopes` / `client_name`. ([FastMCP][5])
2. **Pre-registered client**: `client_id` (and optionally `client_secret`), which skips Dynamic Client Registration. ([FastMCP][5])
3. **CIMD client**: `client_metadata_url=...`, discussed below. ([FastMCP][5])

### 22.9.2 OAuth flow and token storage

The OAuth docs describe the flow as: check token storage for an existing valid token, discover the server’s OAuth endpoints via a well-known URI if no valid token exists, then run the browser/callback flow and exchange the authorization code for tokens. The same docs say the helper starts a temporary local HTTP callback server on an available port (or a configured callback port) and opens the user’s default browser. ([FastMCP][5])

Tokens are stored **in memory by default**, so they are lost on restart. The docs recommend supplying an `AsyncKeyValue` storage backend for persistence and explicitly advise using **encrypted storage in production** because a token store may accumulate credentials for many servers over time. ([FastMCP][5])

```python id="nhhe7u"
import os
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from key_value.aio.stores.disk import DiskStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuth

encrypted_storage = FernetEncryptionWrapper(
    key_value=DiskStore(directory="~/.fastmcp/oauth-tokens"),
    fernet=Fernet(os.environ["OAUTH_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"]),
)

oauth = OAuth(token_storage=encrypted_storage)

async with Client(
    "https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp",
    auth=oauth,
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

### 22.9.3 OAuth guidance

Use `auth="oauth"` for the simplest interactive flow when defaults are acceptable. Use `OAuth(...)` whenever you need scopes, pre-registered credentials, CIMD, or persistent token storage. For production user-facing apps, persistent **encrypted** token storage should be considered the default. ([FastMCP][5])

---

## 22.10 CIMD via `OAuth(client_metadata_url=...)`

CIMD (Client ID Metadata Documents) is an OAuth enhancement for verifiable client identity. The CIMD docs say it is only relevant for HTTP transports and only works when the server advertises CIMD support. Instead of dynamically registering a fresh opaque `client_id` for every server, the client hosts a JSON metadata document at an HTTPS URL it controls, and that URL itself becomes the `client_id`. ([FastMCP][6])

FastMCP’s client-side entrypoint is simply `client_metadata_url=` on `OAuth(...)`: ([FastMCP][6])

```python id="jlwmmk"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuth

async with Client(
    "https://mcp-server.example.com/mcp",
    auth=OAuth(
        client_metadata_url="https://myapp.example.com/oauth/client.json",
    ),
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

When the server supports CIMD, the docs say the client uses that metadata URL as its `client_id` and skips Dynamic Client Registration. The server fetches the document, validates it, and proceeds with the standard OAuth flow. ([FastMCP][6])

### 22.10.1 CIMD document requirements

The CIMD docs define the main hosting requirements:

* HTTPS only
* non-root path
* public accessibility
* `client_id` field must exactly match the hosting URL. ([FastMCP][6])

They also note that wildcard localhost redirect URIs such as `http://localhost:*/callback` are valid for development clients because FastMCP’s OAuth helper typically binds to an available local port for the callback server. ([FastMCP][6])

Use CIMD when you want the server and the user to see a **verifiable domain-backed client identity** instead of an arbitrary dynamically registered name. That is the exact value proposition articulated by the docs. ([FastMCP][6])

---

## 22.11 Handlers vs `message_handler`

The client constructor supports dedicated handlers plus a general `message_handler`. The notifications docs make the intended division explicit: while `message_handler` receives server-initiated messages, you should use **dedicated callbacks** for most interactive request types:

* `sampling_handler` for sampling requests
* `elicitation_handler` for user-input requests
* `progress_handler` for progress updates
* `log_handler` for log messages.

`message_handler` is primarily for monitoring and reacting to notifications. ([FastMCP][7])

This is a crucial design rule. Use dedicated handlers whenever FastMCP already has a typed callback surface for the protocol feature. Reserve `message_handler` for generic notification monitoring, cache invalidation, or unusual protocol events that do not merit a dedicated callback. ([FastMCP][7])

---

## 22.12 `sampling_handler`

The client sampling docs define the canonical handler signature as:

```python id="ix1z0q"
async def sampling_handler(
    messages: list[SamplingMessage],
    params: SamplingParams,
    context: RequestContext,
) -> str:
    ...
```

In FastMCP 4, this handler is relevant to **legacy/handshake compatibility flows** where server-to-client sampling is negotiated. Modern server code no longer has `ctx.sample()` or `ctx.sample_step()`. Keep a sampling handler only when your client intentionally supports a legacy callback chain; do not design new modern-server workflows around it. ([FastMCP][8])

`SamplingMessage` carries `role` (`"user"` or `"assistant"`) and content (`TextContent | ImageContent | AudioContent`). `SamplingParams` includes fields such as `systemPrompt`, `modelPreferences`, `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `stopSequences`, `tools`, and `toolChoice`. ([FastMCP][8])

```python id="ovggbu"
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.sampling import SamplingMessage, SamplingParams, RequestContext

async def sampling_handler(
    messages: list[SamplingMessage],
    params: SamplingParams,
    context: RequestContext,
) -> str:
    conversation = []
    for message in messages:
        content = message.content.text if hasattr(message.content, "text") else str(message.content)
        conversation.append(f"{message.role}: {content}")

    system_prompt = params.systemPrompt or "You are a helpful assistant."
    # Call your own LLM here.
    return "Generated response"

client = Client(Path("my_mcp_server.py"), sampling_handler=sampling_handler)
```

Use `sampling_handler` only when the client must support a protocol era that permits server-to-client sampling. For FastMCP 4 modern interactions, prefer explicit client-driven orchestration or guard/input-required workflows instead of callback sampling. ([FastMCP][8])

---

## 22.13 `elicitation_handler`

The client elicitation docs define the canonical handler signature as:

```python id="8ngs6u"
async def elicitation_handler(
    message: str,
    response_type: type | None,
    params: ElicitRequestParams,
    context: RequestContext,
) -> ElicitResult | object:
    ...
```

This handler runs when a server uses `ctx.elicit()` to request structured user input during an operation. The docs say FastMCP converts the server’s JSON schema into a Python dataclass type and passes that as `response_type`; if the server expects an empty object, `response_type` is `None`. Returning an ordinary object implicitly accepts the elicitation; returning an explicit `ElicitResult` gives full action control. ([FastMCP][9])

```python id="20fvva"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.elicitation import ElicitResult, ElicitRequestParams, RequestContext

async def elicitation_handler(
    message: str,
    response_type: type | None,
    params: ElicitRequestParams,
    context: RequestContext,
) -> ElicitResult | object:
    user_input = input(f"{message}: ")

    if not user_input:
        return ElicitResult(action="decline")

    return response_type(value=user_input) if response_type else ElicitResult(action="accept")

client = Client(Path("my_mcp_server.py"), elicitation_handler=elicitation_handler)
```

Use `elicitation_handler` when the client has an interactive human input surface. If the client is headless or non-interactive, do not provide this handler unless you have a machine-driven policy for responding to elicitation. ([FastMCP][9])

---

## 22.14 `log_handler`

The client logging docs define `log_handler` as the callback for server-sent log messages. The handler receives a `LogMessage` object with:

* `level`
* `logger`
* `data`, where `data` contains `msg` and `extra`. ([FastMCP][10])

```python id="zlg0kc"
import logging
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.logging import LogMessage

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
LOGGING_LEVEL_MAP = logging.getLevelNamesMapping()

async def log_handler(message: LogMessage):
    msg = message.data.get("msg")
    extra = message.data.get("extra")
    level = LOGGING_LEVEL_MAP.get(message.level.upper(), logging.INFO)
    logger.log(level, msg, extra=extra)

client = Client(Path("my_mcp_server.py"), log_handler=log_handler)
```

The docs also emphasize that `message.data` is structured and remains structured even when logs pass through a FastMCP proxy, which makes it useful for debugging multi-server systems. ([FastMCP][10])

If you do **not** provide a custom `log_handler`, FastMCP’s default handler routes server logs into Python’s logging system at appropriate severities. The docs explicitly note mappings such as `notice -> INFO` and `alert` / `emergency -> CRITICAL`. ([FastMCP][11])

Use a custom `log_handler` when you want structured forwarding into your own logging/observability system; otherwise the default behavior is often sufficient. ([FastMCP][11])

---

## 22.15 `progress_handler`

The progress docs define `progress_handler` as the callback for long-running-operation progress. Its signature is:

```python id="y3ud1q"
async def progress_handler(
    progress: float,
    total: float | None,
    message: str | None,
) -> None:
    ...
```

The handler receives current progress, optional total, and optional message. The docs also show that `progress_handler` can be set at the client level and overridden per `call_tool(...)` invocation. ([FastMCP][12])

```python id="m4hr48"
from fastmcp import Client

async def progress_handler(
    progress: float,
    total: float | None,
    message: str | None,
) -> None:
    if total is not None:
        percentage = (progress / total) * 100
        print(f"Progress: {percentage:.1f}% - {message or ''}")
    else:
        print(f"Progress: {progress} - {message or ''}")

client = Client(Path("my_mcp_server.py"), progress_handler=progress_handler)

# Per-call override
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "long_running_task",
        {"param": "value"},
        progress_handler=progress_handler,
    )
```

If no custom handler is provided, the SDK exposes `default_progress_handler(...)`, which logs progress at debug level. Use a custom handler whenever progress needs to drive a UI, CLI progress display, or metrics sink. ([FastMCP][12])

---

## 22.16 Roots: static and dynamic

Roots let the client tell the server what local resources or filesystem boundaries it can provide. The roots docs define two supported patterns:

* a static list of roots
* a dynamic callback that computes roots when requested. ([FastMCP][13])

Static roots:

```python id="jlwmzo"
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    roots=["/path/to/root1", "/path/to/root2"],
)
```

Dynamic roots:

```python id="pi9qgc"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.roots import RequestContext

async def roots_callback(context: RequestContext) -> list[str]:
    print(f"Server requested roots (Request ID: {context.request_id})")
    return ["/path/to/root1", "/path/to/root2"]

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    roots=roots_callback,
)
```

Use static roots when the local resource boundary is fixed and stable. Use dynamic roots when root availability depends on the request, current workspace, or runtime policy. The roots SDK also exposes helper functions like `create_roots_callback(...)`, but the high-level behavior is already captured by `roots=` on `Client(...)`. ([FastMCP][13])

---

## 22.17 Notifications and `message_handler`

The notifications docs define `message_handler` as the unified notification-monitoring callback. The simplest form is a function receiving each protocol message and filtering for notification types such as:

* `notifications/tools/list_changed`
* `notifications/resources/list_changed`
* `notifications/prompts/list_changed`. ([FastMCP][7])

```python id="hpjlwm"
from fastmcp import Client

async def message_handler(message):
    if hasattr(message, "root"):
        method = message.root.method
        if method == "notifications/tools/list_changed":
            print("Tools changed")
        elif method == "notifications/resources/list_changed":
            print("Resources changed")
        elif method == "notifications/prompts/list_changed":
            print("Prompts changed")

client = Client(Path("my_mcp_server.py"), message_handler=message_handler)
```

For finer-grained dispatch, subclass `fastmcp.client.messages.MessageHandler`. The docs show hook-style methods such as `on_tool_list_changed(...)`, which is the right pattern when you want structured notification routing rather than one large filter function. ([FastMCP][7])

```python id="o2rw8c"
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.messages import MessageHandler
import mcp.types

class MyMessageHandler(MessageHandler):
    async def on_tool_list_changed(
        self,
        notification: mcp.types.ToolListChangedNotification,
    ) -> None:
        print("Tool list changed")

client = Client(Path("my_mcp_server.py"), message_handler=MyMessageHandler())
```

Use `message_handler` for notifications and protocol monitoring. Do **not** treat it as the primary interface for sampling, elicitation, progress, or logging when dedicated handlers already exist. The docs explicitly recommend the dedicated callbacks for those cases. ([FastMCP][7])

---

## 22.18 Best-practice guidance

Use **`StreamableHttpTransport`** for all new production HTTP deployments. The docs explicitly call HTTP/Streamable HTTP the recommended production transport. ([FastMCP][3])

Use **`SSETransport`** only for backward compatibility or specific infrastructure constraints. The docs explicitly say to prefer Streamable HTTP for new deployments. ([FastMCP][3])

When using **STDIO**, always pass `env=...` explicitly for anything the server needs. Do not assume shell variables propagate. Prefer explicit `StdioTransport(...)` over file-path inference for any serious local deployment. ([FastMCP][3])

Use **in-memory transport** for tests and evaluation harnesses when same-process behavior is desirable. Unlike STDIO, it shares environment and memory with the client. ([FastMCP][3])

Use `auth="<token>"` or `BearerAuth(...)` for non-interactive bearer tokens, `auth="oauth"` for the simplest interactive OAuth flow, `OAuth(...)` when you need scopes/storage/pre-registered credentials/CIMD, and `client_metadata_url=...` when you want CIMD-backed verifiable client identity on a supporting server. ([FastMCP][4])

Use **dedicated handlers** for server-initiated interactive capabilities—sampling, elicitation, progress, and logging. Use `message_handler` primarily for notifications and generic protocol observation. ([FastMCP][7])

# FastMCP Advanced — 23) Client-only packaging and `fastmcp-remote`


**FastMCP 4 status.** Pin `fastmcp==4.0.0` / same-version slim dependencies. `fastmcp-remote` remains the remote HTTP→STDIO bridge; do not confuse it with `ClientGroup` or a republishing proxy.

## 23.0 Two different deployment problems

FastMCP 3.3 and 3.4 added two packaging/runtime tools that solve different problems:

```text
fastmcp-slim[client]
    -> Python code wants FastMCP Client/transport functionality
       without installing the full server stack

fastmcp-remote
    -> an MCP host only knows how to spawn STDIO servers,
       but the real MCP endpoint is remote HTTP
```

Do not conflate package footprint optimization with transport bridging. ([FastMCP Updates][1])

---

## 23.1 `fastmcp-slim[client]`

Install:

```bash
pip install "fastmcp-slim[client]"
```

Import namespace remains:

```python
from fastmcp import Client
```

Use it for framework/library code that connects to MCP servers but does not construct/run FastMCP servers itself. The full `fastmcp` package remains the normal choice for servers and Apps. ([Client-Only Package][2])

---

## 23.2 Why slim packaging matters

Benefits:

* smaller dependency graph;
* avoids server-only ASGI/runtime dependencies in client libraries;
* lower conflict risk when embedding MCP connectivity into another framework;
* cleaner responsibility boundary;
* potentially faster environment creation/cold import.

Tradeoff: code may later need a server-side feature and discover that the slim environment intentionally lacks it. Keep client and server dependency groups explicit.

---

## 23.3 Library dependency pattern

For a package whose public API only consumes MCP:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
  "fastmcp-slim[client]",
]
```

Application code:

```python
from fastmcp import Client


async def fetch_tools(url: str):
    async with Client(url) as client:
        return await client.list_tools()
```

Avoid forcing all downstream users to install the full FastMCP server stack when your library never runs a server.

---

## 23.4 `fastmcp-remote` role

`fastmcp-remote` is a standalone stdio bridge.

```text
MCP host
   STDIO
     |
     v
fastmcp-remote process
     |
     | Streamable HTTP (+ OAuth/headers)
     v
remote MCP endpoint
```

FastMCP 3.4.0 introduced this package as a standard bridge pattern. ([fastmcp-remote][3])

---

## 23.5 Minimal bridge invocation

```bash
uvx fastmcp-remote https://example.com/mcp
```

If installed persistently:

```bash
uv tool install fastmcp-remote
fastmcp-remote https://example.com/mcp
```

Pass the full MCP endpoint URL. A common error is providing `https://example.com` when the server actually listens at `https://example.com/mcp`. ([fastmcp-remote][3])

---

## 23.6 Host JSON pattern

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-api": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "fastmcp-remote",
        "https://example.com/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This pattern is useful for hosts whose MCP configuration model assumes every server is a local command even when the actual service is remote.

---

## 23.7 OAuth behavior

The remote bridge supports OAuth for remote endpoints. In typical usage, the first authenticated connection can launch a browser flow and cache tokens locally for subsequent runs. ([fastmcp-remote][3])

Operational questions to answer:

* where tokens are cached;
* filesystem permissions on the cache;
* whether the host runs under the same OS user each time;
* how token revocation/logout is performed;
* whether headless environments can complete browser auth;
* whether corporate proxies/custom CAs are needed.

---

## 23.8 Explicit Authorization header

For pre-provisioned bearer credentials:

```bash
uvx fastmcp-remote \
  https://example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MCP_TOKEN"
```

An explicit Authorization header typically changes/disables automatic OAuth behavior because the bridge already has caller-provided auth material. See exact CLI help for the installed bridge version. ([fastmcp-remote][3])

---

## 23.9 Multiple headers

Repeat the header option when the remote endpoint needs additional gateway metadata:

```bash
uvx fastmcp-remote \
  https://example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MCP_TOKEN" \
  --header "X-Tenant: tenant-a"
```

Security rule: do not put long-lived secrets directly into checked-in JSON if the host supports environment/secret substitution.

---

## 23.10 Bridge initialization must fail loudly

A 3.4 design improvement forwards initialization upstream. Wrong URL, unreachable backend, or upstream initialization/auth failure should fail bridge initialization rather than appearing as an empty connected server. ([FastMCP Updates][1])

Use this behavior in health/diagnostic tooling:

```text
"bridge process exists" != "remote MCP is usable"
```

---

## 23.11 `fastmcp-remote` vs programmatic `Client`

Use `Client(url)` when you control Python application code:

```python
async with Client("https://example.com/mcp") as client:
    result = await client.call_tool(...)
```

Use `fastmcp-remote` when a third-party host insists on a STDIO command configuration.

Adding an extra process between your own Python client and a remote endpoint is usually unnecessary.

---

## 23.12 `fastmcp-remote` vs custom ProxyProvider gateway

Use remote bridge when:

```text
one remote backend
host requires STDIO
minimal policy/transformation needed
```

Use a custom FastMCP proxy/gateway when:

```text
multiple upstreams
namespacing/transforms
custom auth/authorization
middleware/audit/rate limits
stable gateway endpoint
custom health/readiness
```

---

## 23.13 Child process environment

STDIO hosts may launch the bridge with a restricted environment. If auth depends on env vars, CA paths, proxy configuration, or browser commands, verify what the host actually passes to the child.

Do not diagnose OAuth failures only from a terminal invocation if the real host process has a different environment.

---

## 23.14 Endpoint diagnostics

When the bridge fails:

1. `curl`/HTTP reachability alone is insufficient—verify the endpoint speaks MCP.
2. Check `/mcp` vs root path.
3. Check TLS/CA/proxy behavior.
4. Check auth discovery/redirect URLs.
5. Run `fastmcp-remote` manually under the same OS user.
6. Inspect stderr/log output from the host-launched process.
7. Verify cached OAuth credentials are readable and not stale.

---

## 23.15 Version alignment

`fastmcp-remote` is a separate package and can evolve independently. Record its version alongside the server's FastMCP version in reproducible host configs.

Example wrapper script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec uvx --from "fastmcp-remote==<pinned-version>" \
  fastmcp-remote "https://example.com/mcp"
```

Use the actual current package pin from your lock/config; do not copy a placeholder version from this reference.

---

## 23.16 Security posture for desktop bridges

A desktop bridge may persist tokens on a user workstation. Apply normal local-secret hygiene:

* user-only file permissions;
* OS disk encryption where required;
* no token values in debug logs;
* clean logout/revocation process;
* avoid shared OS accounts;
* use short-lived/refreshable tokens;
* scope remote permissions to the MCP capability set.

---

## 23.17 Agent integration pattern

For an LLM coding agent that can execute shell commands but cannot natively connect to remote MCP:

```text
agent shell
  -> fastmcp CLI / fastmcp-remote
  -> remote MCP
```

Prefer `fastmcp list`/`call` or generated CLI workflows when the agent only needs occasional deterministic operations; prefer a persistent MCP client integration when it needs rich session/progress/notification behavior.

---

## 23.18 Anti-pattern inventory

* installing full FastMCP in every downstream client library without need;
* importing from a fictitious `fastmcp_slim` namespace;
* running `fastmcp-remote` between your own Python `Client` and the server;
* giving the bridge the host root instead of full MCP path;
* committing bearer tokens into host JSON;
* assuming bridge process success means upstream initialization succeeded;
* relying on shell OAuth/cache environment that the actual desktop host does not inherit;
* using a simple remote bridge when policy requires a real gateway;
* leaving token cache permissions/world-readable state unreviewed.

---

## 23.19 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Client-only Python package? Consider fastmcp-slim[client].
[ ] Server process? Use full fastmcp package.
[ ] STDIO-only host connecting to remote HTTP? Use fastmcp-remote.
[ ] Pass full /mcp endpoint URL.
[ ] Decide OAuth vs explicit Authorization header.
[ ] Keep secrets out of checked-in host JSON.
[ ] Verify child-process environment and token cache permissions.
[ ] Pin bridge/package versions for reproducible deployments.
[ ] Use a custom ProxyProvider gateway when transforms/policy/multiple upstreams are needed.

# FastMCP Advanced — 24) Apps and interactive UI delivery
### Apps and interactive UI delivery

**FastMCP 4 status.** Apps remain a first-class rendering plane. Validate app/extension interoperability on the protocol eras and hosts you support.


### 24.0 Apps as a separate product surface

FastMCP Apps are not “just prettier tool outputs.” They are a distinct product surface layered on MCP tools: a tool returns UI metadata and structured payload, the host renders that payload inside a sandboxed iframe, and UI interactions can call back into the server through the MCP Apps extension. The architecture docs compress the full path as `Python components → JSON tree → structuredContent → Renderer iframe → Host UI`, with host/iframe communication handled through `postMessage` and the `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` AppBridge SDK. ([gofastmcp.com][1])

The `fastmcp.apps` package is the dedicated API surface for this layer. The SDK package index defines it as containing `FastMCPApp`, `AppConfig`, and the security primitives `ResourceCSP` and `ResourcePermissions`. That is the cleanest boundary: plain `FastMCP` gives you server components; `fastmcp.apps` gives you app-specific composition, UI configuration, and security metadata. ([gofastmcp.com][2])

### 24.1 Decision tree: which app architecture to choose

The official overview gives a crisp four-way decision tree. Start with **Prefab Apps**—`@mcp.tool(app=True)` plus a Prefab return—when you want charts, tables, dashboards, or client-side interactivity without significant server-side tool orchestration. Move to **FastMCPApp** when the UI needs multiple backend tools, managed visibility, and composition-safe tool routing. Choose **GenerativeUI** when the LLM should synthesize the UI at runtime instead of calling prebuilt tools with fixed interfaces. Drop to **Custom HTML Apps** when you need your own HTML/CSS/JavaScript, a specific frontend framework, or capabilities like maps, 3D, or video that are outside Prefab’s component model. ([gofastmcp.com][3])

A good operational heuristic is therefore: `app=True` for display-first tools, `FastMCPApp` for server-connected applications, `GenerativeUI` for model-authored UIs, and low-level `AppConfig + ui://resource` HTML when you need full renderer control. The docs state that FastMCP also ships ready-made app providers, but those sit orthogonally to this decision tree—they are convenience providers on top of the same app surface. ([gofastmcp.com][3])

### 24.2 Prefab Apps: `@mcp.tool(app=True)` as the simplest UI path

The shortest app path is a normal tool decorated with `app=True` that returns a Prefab UI object such as `PrefabApp`. The Prefab docs and Apps overview both state that this is the simplest way to turn a tool into an interactive UI: the host renders a UI instead of plain JSON/text, and this supports everything from static displays to reactive dashboards with client-side state and actions. ([gofastmcp.com][4])

```python id="n8m3a4"
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp
from prefab_ui.components import Column, Heading
from prefab_ui.components.charts import BarChart, ChartSeries
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Dashboard")

@mcp.tool(app=True)
def revenue_chart(year: int) -> PrefabApp:
    data = [
        {"quarter": "Q1", "revenue": 42000},
        {"quarter": "Q2", "revenue": 51000},
        {"quarter": "Q3", "revenue": 47000},
        {"quarter": "Q4", "revenue": 63000},
    ]
    with Column(gap=4, css_class="p-6") as view:
        Heading(f"{year} Revenue")
        BarChart(
            data=data,
            series=[ChartSeries(data_key="revenue", label="Revenue")],
            x_axis="quarter",
        )
    return PrefabApp(view=view)
```

When the host calls such a tool, FastMCP serializes the Prefab component tree to JSON, places it into `structuredContent`, and the shared Prefab renderer paints it in the iframe. By default, the tool still emits a small text `content` payload—`"[Rendered Prefab UI]"`—so the LLM knows something was rendered; if you need to control both the text half and the UI half, return an explicit `ToolResult`. ([gofastmcp.com][4])

Use `app=True` when the UI is mostly self-contained and server round-trips are minimal or optional. The docs explicitly note that there is “no hard wall” stopping a Prefab app from calling other tools via `CallTool`, but they also frame `FastMCPApp` as the better abstraction once backend interaction becomes nontrivial. ([gofastmcp.com][3])

### 24.3 Production caveat: `prefab-ui` must be pinned by you

This is the single most important production warning on the Apps surface. Both the overview, Prefab page, and FastMCPApp page state that Prefab is in early active development, that FastMCP pins only a **minimum** compatible `prefab-ui` version, and that it **does not pin an upper bound**. The docs explicitly say that production deployments should pin `prefab-ui` to a specific version in your own dependencies, because an unpinned fresh deploy can resolve a newer breaking Prefab release and break your UI. ([gofastmcp.com][3])

The correct production policy is therefore: pin `fastmcp`, pin `prefab-ui`, and treat the app surface as a versioned application dependency set rather than assuming FastMCP alone constrains all runtime UI dependencies. ([gofastmcp.com][3])

### 24.4 `FastMCPApp`: managed app composition for server-connected UIs

`FastMCPApp` is a **Provider**, not a different server type. The SDK defines it as a composable MCP application provider that binds together entry-point tools (`@app.ui()`), backend tools (`@app.tool()`), and the Prefab renderer resource. The interactive-app guide positions it specifically for apps with heavy server interaction, where plain `app=True` plus string-based `CallTool("...")` references become fragile under namespacing and growth. ([gofastmcp.com][5])

The documented attachment pattern is provider-based:

```python id="v6s7u1"
from fastmcp import FastMCP, FastMCPApp

app = FastMCPApp("Contacts")

@app.ui()
def contact_manager():
    ...

@app.tool()
def save_contact(name: str, email: str):
    ...

mcp = FastMCP("Platform", providers=[app])
# or:
# mcp = FastMCP("Platform")
# mcp.add_provider(app)
```

This is the correct object-model boundary: `FastMCPApp` is added to a server the same way any other provider is added. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

### 24.5 `@app.ui()` — model-visible entry points

`@app.ui()` registers entry-point tools that the **model** calls to open the app. The interactive-app docs say these return Prefab UI, default to `visibility=["model"]`, auto-wire the shared Prefab renderer resource and CSP, and support the same major options as `@mcp.tool`, including `name`, `description`, `title`, `tags`, `icons`, `auth`, and `timeout`. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

```python id="3el9kg"
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp
from prefab_ui.components import Column, Heading
from fastmcp import FastMCPApp

app = FastMCPApp("Dashboard")

@app.ui(title="Contact Manager", description="Open the contact management interface")
def contact_manager() -> PrefabApp:
    with Column(gap=4, css_class="p-6") as view:
        Heading("Contacts")
    return PrefabApp(view=view)
```

Use `@app.ui()` when the app should appear in the model-visible tool list as the entry point into a larger UI flow. The model sees the entry tool; it does not need to see every internal mutation/search/save backend operation. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

### 24.6 `@app.tool()` — app-visible backend tools

`@app.tool()` registers backend tools for the UI to call via `CallTool`. The docs say these tools default to `visibility=["app"]`, are hidden from the model by default, and support `name`, `description`, `auth`, and `timeout`. Passing `model=True` exposes them to both the model and the app UI. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

```python id="5z4l1o"
from fastmcp import FastMCPApp

app = FastMCPApp("Contacts")
db: list[dict] = []

@app.tool()
def save_contact(name: str, email: str) -> list[dict]:
    db.append({"name": name, "email": email})
    return list(db)

@app.tool(model=True)
def list_contacts() -> list[dict]:
    return list(db)
```

The separation is deliberate: entry points open the app; backend tools do the work. Use `model=True` only when the same operation is genuinely useful both as a conversational tool and as an in-app action. Otherwise keep backend tools app-only to reduce model-visible catalog noise. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

### 24.7 Why `FastMCPApp` exists: stable backend routing and visibility discipline

The main value of `FastMCPApp` is not “it can call tools”; ordinary `app=True` Prefab apps can already do that. The value is **managed binding**: backend tools get stable identifiers that survive namespacing, visibility is automatically partitioned between model-visible and app-visible tools, and `CallTool` can accept **function references** instead of raw strings, making internal tool references refactorable and composition-safe. The docs explain this explicitly. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

The architecture docs reveal how this works. `FastMCPApp` tags both entry points and backend tools with `meta["fastmcp"]["app"]`; during serialization it injects `_meta.fastmcp.app` into `structuredContent`; when the renderer later calls a backend tool, the server sees that tag and uses `get_app_tool(app_name, tool_name)` instead of normal `get_tool(name)`. That bypasses the normal transform chain, so a backend tool like `save_contact` still resolves correctly even if the parent server mounted the app under a namespace and transformed the model-visible tool name. Authorization still runs. ([gofastmcp.com][1])

That makes `FastMCPApp` the correct abstraction whenever your UI has multiple backend calls, may be mounted under namespaces, or must survive refactors without brittle string tool-name coupling. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

### 24.8 `CallTool(...)`, result handling, and `result_key`

The interactive-app docs define `CallTool` as the bridge between the UI and server. It can accept either a tool name string or a backend tool function reference, and function references are the safer form when the tool is defined in the same file because FastMCP resolves them to stable backend identifiers automatically. The same docs also document `result_key` as shorthand for “store the successful result into this state key.” ([gofastmcp.com][6])

```python id="s8b6ry"
from prefab_ui.actions import SetState, ShowToast
from prefab_ui.actions.mcp import CallTool
from prefab_ui.rx import RESULT, STATE

# Function reference form is composition-safe
CallTool(
    save_contact,
    arguments={"name": STATE.name, "email": STATE.email},
    on_success=[
        SetState("contacts", RESULT),
        ShowToast("Saved"),
    ],
)

# result_key shorthand
CallTool("list_contacts", result_key="contacts")
```

Use string names only when the backend tool reference is not directly importable in the UI definition site. Prefer function references when possible; the docs explicitly position them as the refactor-safe/composition-safe form. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

### 24.9 `FastMCPApp.run()` — standalone development path

`FastMCPApp` exposes a `run(...)` convenience method that wraps the app in a temporary `FastMCP` server and runs it standalone. The interactive-app docs and SDK both document this as a development convenience, not a fundamentally different deployment mode. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

```python id="7vtgtg"
from fastmcp import FastMCPApp

app = FastMCPApp("Contacts")

# ... register @app.ui() / @app.tool() ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Use `app.run()` for quick standalone development when the app is the only thing you need to serve. Use `providers=[app]` / `add_provider(app)` when the app is one capability surface inside a larger platform server. ([gofastmcp.com][6])

### 24.10 `GenerativeUI()` — runtime LLM-authored Prefab UIs

`GenerativeUI` is a **Provider** that lets the model generate Prefab Python code at runtime and render it as a streaming UI. The docs say it registers three things: a generation tool (`generate_prefab_ui` in the high-level docs, `generate_ui` in the SDK reference naming), a component-search tool, and a renderer resource using browser-side Pyodide for streaming. The high-level provider docs describe the registered public tool names as `generate_prefab_ui` and `search_prefab_components`; the SDK reference describes the internal capability as `generate_ui` plus `components`, but both agree on the functional model: code generation tool + component search tool + renderer resource. ([gofastmcp.com][7])

```python id="jlwmqd"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.apps.generative import GenerativeUI

mcp = FastMCP("Prefab Studio")
mcp.add_provider(GenerativeUI())
```

The provider docs state that the LLM writes real Python using Prefab’s component library, that partial code is streamed to the renderer via `ontoolinputpartial`, and that the user watches the UI build up in real time. Configuration options include renaming the generation tool, renaming the component-search tool, and omitting the search tool entirely. ([gofastmcp.com][7])

Use `GenerativeUI` when the UI shape itself should be model-authored at runtime rather than fixed in code. Do **not** use it when you need a strongly versioned, carefully curated UI contract—use Prefab/FastMCPApp/custom HTML in those cases. That recommendation is an engineering conclusion directly supported by the docs’ framing of GenerativeUI as “let the LLM generate custom UIs at runtime.” ([gofastmcp.com][7])

The provider docs also give concrete operational constraints: `fastmcp[apps]` is required, a Pyodide validation sandbox runs server-side and needs Deno on first use, the browser-side renderer loads Pyodide from a CDN with CSP configured automatically, and the sandbox includes only the standard library plus Prefab—not arbitrary external Python packages like NumPy or pandas. Those are real deployment constraints, not incidental details. ([gofastmcp.com][7])

### 24.11 Custom HTML Apps via the MCP Apps extension

When Prefab is the wrong abstraction, drop to the MCP Apps extension directly. The low-level apps docs define the custom HTML model as two artifacts: a tool that returns data and a `ui://...` resource containing the HTML that renders that data. The tool links to the resource via `AppConfig(resource_uri=...)`, the host fetches the linked UI resource, renders it inside a sandboxed iframe, and pushes the tool result into it via `postMessage`. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

Canonical low-level pattern:

```python id="mnnxpp"
import json
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.apps import AppConfig

mcp = FastMCP("My App Server")

@mcp.tool(app=AppConfig(resource_uri="ui://my-app/view.html"))
def generate_chart(data: list[float]) -> str:
    return json.dumps({"values": data})

@mcp.resource("ui://my-app/view.html")
def chart_view() -> str:
    return "<html>...</html>"
```

This is the right path when you need custom rendering stacks, maps, 3D, video, or a JavaScript framework not represented naturally as Prefab components. The docs explicitly position it that way. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

### 24.12 `AppConfig`: the low-level app wiring object

`AppConfig` is the low-level configuration object for how a tool or resource participates in the Apps extension. On tools, the main field is `resource_uri`; on tools and resources, additional fields include `csp`, `permissions`, `domain`, and `prefers_border`; and on tools only, `visibility` controls whether the tool is visible to the model, only the app, or both. The docs also say you can pass a raw dict with camelCase wire-format keys instead of an `AppConfig` instance. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

The documented fields are:

* `resource_uri`: UI resource URI, tools only
* `visibility`: `["model"]`, `["app"]`, or both, tools only
* `csp`: `ResourceCSP` for iframe CSP
* `permissions`: `ResourcePermissions` for iframe sandbox/browser capabilities
* `domain`: stable sandbox origin
* `prefers_border`: UI border preference. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

On resources, `resource_uri` and `visibility` must **not** be set, because the resource **is** the UI. The docs state that clearly. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

### 24.13 `ui://` resources and MIME semantics

Resources using the `ui://` scheme are automatically served with MIME type `text/html;profile=mcp-app`. The custom HTML docs say you do not need to set this manually. The host renders these resources in a sandboxed iframe and opens an AppBridge communication channel back to the host/server. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

```python id="jzru1i"
@mcp.resource("ui://my-app/view.html")
def my_view() -> str:
    return "<html><body>Hello</body></html>"
```

This `ui://` resource model is one of the most important boundaries in the app system: tools do work and return data; `ui://` resources render that data. Once you drop to custom HTML, think in those two artifacts explicitly. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

### 24.14 Security: CSP and permissions for custom HTML

Custom HTML apps run in sandboxed iframes with a deny-by-default Content Security Policy. The docs say that by default only inline scripts/styles are allowed and there is no external network access. If the UI needs CDN assets, API requests, or nested frames, those domains must be declared through `ResourceCSP`. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

```python id="hi2b0k"
from fastmcp.apps import AppConfig, ResourceCSP

@mcp.resource(
    "ui://my-app/view.html",
    app=AppConfig(
        csp=ResourceCSP(
            resource_domains=["https://unpkg.com", "https://cdn.example.com"],
            connect_domains=["https://api.example.com"],
        )
    ),
)
def my_view() -> str:
    return "<html>...</html>"
```

The documented CSP field meanings are:

* `connect_domains` for `fetch` / XHR / WebSocket
* `resource_domains` for scripts/images/styles/fonts
* `frame_domains` for nested iframes
* `base_uri_domains` for document `base-uri`. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

Browser capabilities such as camera or clipboard access are requested through `ResourcePermissions`, but the docs explicitly warn that hosts may or may not grant them, so your UI should use feature detection/fallbacks rather than assuming success. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

```python id="l7v6ns"
from fastmcp.apps import AppConfig, ResourcePermissions

@mcp.resource(
    "ui://my-app/view.html",
    app=AppConfig(
        permissions=ResourcePermissions(
            camera={},
            clipboard_write={},
        )
    ),
)
def my_view() -> str:
    return "<html>...</html>"
```

### 24.15 Host support detection and fallback behavior

Not all MCP hosts support the Apps extension. The custom HTML docs explicitly recommend checking support at runtime using `ctx.client_supports_extension(UI_EXTENSION_ID)` and falling back to plain-text or non-app responses when necessary. This is equally relevant for Prefab and custom HTML, even though the example is shown on the low-level page. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

```python id="r4jns2"
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
from fastmcp.apps import AppConfig, UI_EXTENSION_ID

mcp = FastMCP("Adaptive Apps")

@mcp.tool(app=AppConfig(resource_uri="ui://my-app/view.html"))
async def my_tool(ctx: Context) -> str:
    if ctx.client_supports_extension(UI_EXTENSION_ID):
        return "rich-response"
    return "plain-text-fallback"
```

Use this pattern whenever the server must behave reasonably in both app-capable and non-app-capable clients. Treat app support as a runtime capability check, not as a universal assumption. ([gofastmcp.com][8])

### 24.16 Local previewing with `fastmcp dev apps`

`fastmcp dev apps ...` is the official local preview environment for app tools. The development docs say it launches a browser-based preview with no MCP host client required, works for both Prefab apps and custom HTML apps, starts your MCP server and a local dev UI side by side, auto-generates input forms from the tool schema, and opens rendered results in a new tab. ([gofastmcp.com][9])

```bash id="z1ek7x"
fastmcp dev apps server.py
fastmcp dev apps server.py:mcp --mcp-port 9000 --dev-port 9090 --no-reload
```

The default ports are documented as MCP server on `8000` and dev UI on `8080`, with auto-reload on by default. The dev UI also includes an inspector panel that shows JSON-RPC and AppBridge traffic in real time, which is especially useful for debugging app tool arguments, returned `structuredContent`, and UI-to-server `CallTool` traffic. ([gofastmcp.com][9])

Architecturally, the dev server runs two HTTP servers and a reverse proxy at `/mcp`. The architecture docs explain why: the renderer iframe runs on the dev UI origin, while your MCP server runs on another port, so the reverse proxy makes `callServerTool` same-origin and avoids browser CORS blocking. That makes `fastmcp dev apps` a reasonably faithful host simulation rather than a toy preview. ([gofastmcp.com][9])

### 24.17 Production guidance

Use plain `@mcp.tool(app=True)` plus Prefab returns for **display-first** tools or small self-contained UIs. Use `FastMCPApp` for **server-connected applications** with multiple backend calls, visibility partitioning, and composition-safe tool routing. Use `GenerativeUI()` when the **model should design the UI**, not when you need a fixed audited interface. Use Custom HTML / `AppConfig(resource_uri=...)` when you need **full frontend control**, custom JavaScript frameworks, or browser features beyond Prefab’s component model. This four-way split is directly supported by the official Apps overview. ([gofastmcp.com][3])

Pin `prefab-ui` in production. Treat `fastmcp dev apps` as the local preview/debug loop, not as a deployment topology. Treat host app-support checks as a real capability boundary and implement fallbacks when the same tool must behave well in non-app MCP clients. And when building custom HTML apps, treat CSP and permissions as production configuration, not optional polish, because the default runtime is sandboxed and deny-by-default. ([gofastmcp.com][3])

# FastMCP Advanced — 25) Prefab, built-in app providers, Generative UI, and custom renderers
### Prefab, built-in app providers, Generative UI, and custom renderers

**FastMCP 4 status.** Prefab/Generative UI remain app-layer capabilities; pin UI dependencies and test host support independently from core MCP support.


### 25.0 Scope and version frame

FastMCP 3.2 made Apps a first-class stable product surface rather than an experimental side channel. The stable 3.4.x line includes the Prefab renderer path, `FastMCPApp`, built-in app providers for approval/choice/forms/files, Generative UI, and the lower-level MCP Apps resource model. Section 24 explains the architecture; this section is the implementation catalog and production decision guide.

The core invariant is:

```text
model-visible tool
  -> tool call
      -> normal MCP result content
      -> structuredContent + UI metadata
          -> host loads ui:// renderer in sandboxed iframe
              -> UI may call app-visible backend tools
```

Apps are therefore **not a separate transport**. They remain tools/resources on the same MCP connection, with additional metadata and renderer resources layered on top.

---

## 25.1 App architecture decision table

| Need | Prefer | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One chart/table/dashboard returned by one tool | `@mcp.tool(app=True)` | Lowest ceremony; normal tool with a Prefab return |
| UI with several server-side backend actions | `FastMCPApp` | Stable backend identity, app/model visibility, composition-safe routing |
| Standard human confirmation UX | `Approval()` | Adds a reusable model-visible approval card tool |
| Fixed choices as buttons | `Choice()` | Removes ambiguous free-text selection UX |
| Structured form generated from a Pydantic model | `FormInput(model=...)` | Server-side schema validation and typed submission |
| Drag-and-drop files outside the LLM context window | `FileUpload()` | UI upload + model-visible list/read tools |
| Let the model synthesize a bespoke Prefab UI | `GenerativeUI()` | Runtime model-authored UI in a sandbox |
| Full custom frontend/framework | MCP Apps custom HTML / `AppConfig` | Maximum control over HTML/CSS/JS and renderer behavior |

Agent rule: start with the smallest app abstraction that satisfies the interaction. Do not build a custom renderer when a built-in provider or Prefab component tree expresses the workflow cleanly.

---

## 25.2 `app=True`: display-first Prefab tools

Representative stable pattern:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp
from prefab_ui.components import Column, Heading, Text

mcp = FastMCP("Reports")

@mcp.tool(app=True)
def show_summary(project: str) -> PrefabApp:
    with Column(gap=4) as view:
        Heading(f"Summary — {project}")
        Text("Rendered as an MCP App rather than plain text only.")
    return PrefabApp(view=view)
```

Use `app=True` when:

* the tool already has a natural model-facing invocation;
* its primary result is visual or interactive;
* the UI can be represented by Prefab;
* backend tool topology is minimal.

Do not treat the rendered UI as the only contract. Tool `content` and `structuredContent` still matter for compatibility, logging, testing, and hosts that do not render Apps.

### Automatic Prefab recognition

FastMCP can recognize Prefab return annotations and supply the app metadata/renderer path automatically. For agent-authored production code, explicit `app=True` is often clearer because it makes the UI contract visible at the decorator rather than relying on type-driven inference.

---

## 25.3 `FastMCPApp`: server-connected application bundle

When an app needs backend tools, use `FastMCPApp` as a provider:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, FastMCPApp
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp

contacts = FastMCPApp("Contacts")

@contacts.tool()
def save_contact(name: str, email: str) -> dict:
    return {"name": name, "email": email, "saved": True}

@contacts.ui()
def contacts_ui() -> PrefabApp:
    # Construct the Prefab UI and refer to backend functions/actions here.
    ...

mcp = FastMCP("Platform", providers=[contacts])
```

The important semantic split is:

```text
@app.ui()    -> model-visible entry tool by default
@app.tool()  -> app-visible backend tool by default
```

This avoids exposing every UI implementation helper to the model while still allowing the renderer to invoke those helpers. FastMCP tags and resolves backend tools by app identity so namespacing/composition does not accidentally break UI calls.

### Why string-based backend names are fragile

A plain `CallTool("save_contact")` string can become stale if a provider is namespaced or transformed. `FastMCPApp` lets FastMCP resolve backend identities late enough that the client-visible name can change while the app relationship remains intact.

---

## 25.4 `Approval`: human-in-the-loop UX, not a security boundary

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.apps.approval import Approval

mcp = FastMCP("Operations")
mcp.add_provider(Approval())
```

The provider adds a model-visible approval tool that presents an Approve/Reject UI and returns the user's choice through the conversation.

Use it for:

* deployment confirmations;
* purchase/payment UX;
* bulk mutation confirmation;
* user-friendly review before a sensitive action.

Critical invariant:

```text
Approval UI = advisory interaction
server authorization / state transition = enforcement
```

A model can ignore an advisory card, a conversation can continue, and hosts differ in interaction semantics. If approval is a hard requirement, the mutation tool itself must verify an enforceable server-side approval token/state/authorization condition before changing anything.

Example policy shape:

```python
@mcp.tool
def delete_records(batch_id: str, approval_token: str) -> dict:
    verify_server_side_approval(batch_id, approval_token)
    return perform_delete(batch_id)
```

The UI can obtain/present the approval flow, but enforcement belongs inside trusted server logic.

---

## 25.5 `Choice`: bounded selection UX

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.apps.choice import Choice

mcp = FastMCP("Planner")
mcp.add_provider(Choice(title="Choose an Option"))
```

`Choice` is useful when the correct interaction is a small closed set rather than arbitrary prose. Typical cases:

* deployment strategy;
* environment selection;
* report format;
* workflow branch;
* “pick one of these candidates.”

Like `Approval`, it is interaction UX, not policy enforcement. If only three enum values are valid for a later tool, that later tool should still validate the enum itself.

---

## 25.6 `FormInput`: Pydantic model -> validated interactive form

```python
from typing import Literal
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.apps.form import FormInput

class IncidentReport(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="Short incident title")
    severity: Literal["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]
    description: str = Field(description="What happened")

mcp = FastMCP("Incident Intake")
mcp.add_provider(FormInput(model=IncidentReport))
```

This is the preferred app primitive when:

* the interaction should produce a structured object;
* validation belongs on the server;
* free-text parsing would be brittle;
* the form can be generated from Pydantic/JSON Schema.

Design guidance:

1. Keep the Pydantic model narrow and user-facing.
2. Use `Field(...)` descriptions and constraints as the canonical form contract.
3. Validate again at the final business action boundary when the action has additional contextual constraints.
4. Do not put secrets into form defaults or renderer metadata.

---

## 25.7 `FileUpload`: data plane outside the model context window

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.apps.file_upload import FileUpload

mcp = FastMCP("Document Tools")
mcp.add_provider(
    FileUpload(
        max_file_size=10 * 1024 * 1024,
        title="Upload documents",
    )
)
```

The built-in provider exposes an upload UI plus model-visible file-list/read capabilities. This is high leverage because binary/file ingress can happen through the app renderer rather than forcing the file bytes through the model context.

### Session-scope warning

Default file storage is session-scoped and in-memory. That aligns naturally with STDIO, SSE, and stateful HTTP sessions. It is **not sufficient for stateless HTTP** because consecutive requests may not share the same session identifier.

For stateless or horizontally scaled deployments:

```text
UI upload request
    -> durable object/file store keyed by authenticated principal or stable workflow id
model list/read request
    -> same durable store and same stable authorization scope
```

Never derive the stable key from a client-supplied filename or unchecked arbitrary string. Prefer authenticated subject/tenant IDs plus server-generated object IDs.

### File security checklist

* enforce a server-side maximum byte size;
* sanitize/replace filenames rather than trusting paths;
* reject path traversal and absolute paths;
* content-sniff or validate MIME where relevant;
* virus/malware scan when files enter higher-risk enterprise workflows;
* use authenticated scope keys in stateless deployments;
* apply retention/deletion policy;
* do not expose one user's uploads to another principal.

---

## 25.8 `GenerativeUI`: model-authored Prefab at runtime

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.apps.generative import GenerativeUI

mcp = FastMCP("Prefab Studio")
mcp.add_provider(GenerativeUI())
```

The provider gives the model a UI-generation tool and a component-search capability. The model writes Prefab Python dynamically; execution/rendering occurs in sandboxed environments rather than running arbitrary generated Python directly in the host process.

Use Generative UI when the **layout itself is part of the reasoning problem**: exploratory dashboards, ad hoc visualization, contextual forms, or synthesized work surfaces.

Avoid it when:

* the UI must be pixel-stable and thoroughly pretested;
* model-generated code is unacceptable under the threat model;
* the workflow has strict accessibility/compliance review requirements that demand fixed UI artifacts;
* a simple static Prefab tool already solves the problem.

### Sandbox is necessary, not sufficient

Sandboxing generated UI code limits execution risk, but your backend tools still define what effects are possible. Apply normal auth, authorization, validation, and destructive-action policy to every backend tool. Never assume “the code ran in Pyodide” means the full application is safe.

---

## 25.9 Prefab version pinning

FastMCP intentionally does not make the app renderer dependency a permanently frozen implementation detail. The Prefab surface evolves quickly, so production deployments should pin **both** the FastMCP version and the Prefab UI version used in acceptance tests.

Example:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
  "fastmcp==4.0.0",
  "prefab-ui==<YOUR_TESTED_VERSION>",
]
```

Do not copy an arbitrary Prefab version from this reference: pin the version your project actually tests. The important rule is to avoid an unconstrained fresh resolution on production deploys.

---

## 25.10 Custom HTML / low-level MCP Apps

Use a custom renderer when Prefab cannot express the interface. The low-level pattern is conceptually:

```text
tool metadata -> resourceUri = ui://...
ui:// resource -> HTML/JS/CSS renderer
ToolResult.structured_content -> application data
iframe <-> host AppBridge -> tool calls/messages/state
```

Production custom-renderer concerns:

* CSP (`ResourceCSP`) and explicit resource origins;
* permissions (`ResourcePermissions`);
* no secrets embedded in HTML payloads;
* strict input validation on UI-originated tool calls;
* versioned frontend assets;
* browser isolation assumptions;
* compatibility testing in every target MCP host.

If the UI requires a mature React/Vue/Svelte application, keep the frontend build system explicit instead of hiding a large frontend bundle inside an improvised Python string.

---

## 25.11 App testing matrix

Test at four layers:

| Layer | Test |
| --- | --- |
| Tool contract | Entry tool appears with intended model visibility and schema |
| Structured result | `structuredContent` contains the expected app payload |
| Backend routing | App-visible backend tool resolves after namespace/provider transforms |
| Host rendering | Target host actually renders and can round-trip actions |

Additional cases:

```text
[ ] model-visible app entry exists
[ ] app-only backend tools are not leaked into model tool list
[ ] namespace transform does not break backend references
[ ] unauthorized backend call is rejected
[ ] renderer handles tool error state
[ ] file upload limit is enforced server-side
[ ] stateless deployment uses stable file scope
[ ] approval is not treated as security enforcement
[ ] Prefab version is pinned in the project lockfile
```

---

## 25.12 Anti-pattern inventory

* Treating `Approval` as cryptographic authorization.
* Exposing every app backend helper to the model.
* Hard-coding transformed tool names inside a composable app.
* Running user/model-authored Python in the FastMCP server process instead of a sandbox.
* Using default session-scoped `FileUpload` storage in stateless HTTP.
* Trusting uploaded filenames as filesystem paths.
* Letting an unconstrained `prefab-ui` version float in production.
* Assuming every MCP client renders Apps.
* Omitting plain-content/error behavior because “the UI will handle it.”
* Putting secrets into renderer metadata or `structuredContent`.

---

## 25.13 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Choose app=True vs FastMCPApp vs built-in provider vs GenerativeUI vs custom HTML deliberately.
[ ] Keep app-only backend tools hidden from the model unless model access is intentional.
[ ] Treat Approval/Choice as UX, not enforcement.
[ ] Use Pydantic validation for FormInput contracts.
[ ] Give FileUpload a durable authenticated scope in stateless/scaled deployments.
[ ] Enforce file size/path/type policy server-side.
[ ] Apply auth/authorization to every effectful backend tool.
[ ] Pin prefab-ui alongside FastMCP for production Apps.
[ ] Test structuredContent plus actual host rendering.
[ ] Verify namespaces/transforms do not break app-backend routing.
```

# FastMCP Advanced — 26) OpenAPI and FastAPI integration
### OpenAPI and FastAPI integration

**FastMCP 4 status.** FastMCP's HTTP stack now uses `httpx2`. `FastMCP.from_openapi(client=...)` / `OpenAPIProvider(client=...)` should receive `httpx2.AsyncClient`; old `httpx.AsyncClient` acceptance is temporary compatibility behavior.


### 26.0 Scope and stable-version stance

FastMCP can generate MCP components from OpenAPI specifications and from FastAPI applications. In the v3 architecture, this is provider-driven: an `OpenAPIProvider` is a component source, and `FastMCP.from_openapi(...)` / `FastMCP.from_fastapi(...)` are convenience construction paths around that capability.

Use this integration as an **accelerator**, not as a claim that REST endpoint design and model-facing tool design are equivalent. A generated server can expose an API quickly, but large or implementation-shaped OpenAPI surfaces usually require curation, descriptions, exclusions, transforms, or a hand-designed facade before they become high-quality agent interfaces.

Version note: this reference targets FastMCP 4.0.0. FastMCP 4 uses `httpx2` internally; custom OpenAPI clients and client factories should therefore use the v4-supported `httpx2` types. The old v3 `httpx` integration assumptions are migration history, not the baseline.

---

## 26.1 `FastMCP.from_openapi(...)`: bootstrap an MCP server from a spec

Stable conceptual pattern:

```python
import httpx
from fastmcp import FastMCP

api_client = httpx.AsyncClient(
    base_url="https://api.example.com",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer ..."},
)

spec = {...}  # parsed OpenAPI document

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=api_client,
    name="Example API",
)
```

The generated server is still a normal `FastMCP` server. You can add handwritten tools/resources/prompts, providers, transforms, middleware, auth, and visibility rules after generation.

### What generation has to do

```text
OpenAPI document
  -> parse paths/operations/parameters/request bodies/responses
  -> generate FastMCP components
  -> map operation inputs to MCP input schemas
  -> use configured HTTP client to call upstream API
  -> convert upstream result to MCP result
```

The upstream HTTP API and the MCP server are two distinct trust boundaries. Do not collapse their authentication or error models accidentally.

---

## 26.2 `OpenAPIProvider`: provider-first composition

When building larger systems, prefer thinking in provider terms:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.providers.openapi import OpenAPIProvider

provider = OpenAPIProvider(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=api_client,
)

mcp = FastMCP("Platform", providers=[provider])
```

Provider-first design is useful when:

* the generated API is only one component source among several;
* you want provider-local transforms;
* several OpenAPI sources are composed under namespaces;
* the provider lifecycle/configuration is managed independently;
* you want to wrap or reuse the source without copying components.

The public convenience constructor is excellent for a one-source server; `OpenAPIProvider` better exposes the v3 architecture for platform composition.

---

## 26.3 Default route mapping: endpoints become tools

FastMCP's current default is intentionally compatibility-oriented: OpenAPI operations become **tools** unless custom route maps say otherwise. This is a pragmatic choice because tool support is the broadest MCP client capability.

Do not infer semantic quality from that default. A read-only `GET /users/{id}` may be semantically resource-like, but exposing it as a tool can still be the better interoperability choice.

---

## 26.4 `RouteMap` and `MCPType`

Custom route mapping lets you decide what becomes a tool, resource, resource template, or excluded operation.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.providers.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

route_maps = [
    RouteMap(
        pattern=r"^/admin/.*",
        mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE,
    ),
    RouteMap(
        methods=["GET"],
        pattern=r"^/public/.*",
        mcp_type=MCPType.RESOURCE,
    ),
]

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=api_client,
    route_maps=route_maps,
)
```

Route-map design dimensions include:

* HTTP method;
* path regex;
* OpenAPI tags;
* target MCP component type;
* custom MCP tags;
* exclusion.

Rules are ordered. Treat rule order as part of the public contract because the first applicable mapping determines how the route is exposed.

---

## 26.5 Exclusion-first policy for large or sensitive APIs

For production-generated servers, default-deny is usually safer than mirroring every endpoint.

Recommended curation sequence:

```text
1. Exclude admin/internal/debug/bulk-destructive endpoints.
2. Exclude endpoints that expose secrets or implementation metadata.
3. Keep a narrow allowlist of useful model-facing operations.
4. Rewrite descriptions and parameter names for model clarity.
5. Namespace or tag the generated surface.
6. Add authorization to effectful components.
7. Add ToolSearch/Code Mode only after the catalog itself is policy-safe.
```

Search transforms reduce **discovery volume**; they do not make an unsafe hidden endpoint safe. Authorization/exclusion must be correct before search is layered on top.

---

## 26.6 Upstream authentication vs MCP authentication

Keep two identities separate:

```text
MCP caller identity
   -> FastMCP authentication/authorization
FastMCP service identity (or delegated caller credential)
   -> upstream API authentication
```

### Service-credential pattern

```python
api_client = httpx.AsyncClient(
    base_url=API_BASE,
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {SERVICE_TOKEN}"},
)
```

All authorized MCP users call the upstream API as the server's service identity. This is simple but means upstream audit logs do not natively distinguish MCP callers.

### Delegated identity pattern

If upstream calls must act as the actual user, extract a validated FastMCP access token/principal and construct a tightly scoped per-request upstream credential. Do **not** blindly forward every inbound header or cookie.

Security rule:

```text
validated claim -> explicit upstream credential mapping
not
incoming HTTP headers -> copy all to upstream
```

This avoids credential confusion and accidental leakage across origins.

---

## 26.7 OpenAPI server variables and parameter encodings

Real specifications may use:

* server URL variables;
* path/query/header/cookie parameters;
* arrays and nested values;
* `deepObject` query encoding;
* multiple content types;
* request-body schemas;
* response schemas.

FastMCP 3.x continued to improve these edge cases. When the generated server is business-critical, add integration fixtures from the actual API for every nontrivial parameter style rather than assuming the OpenAPI schema conversion alone guarantees correct wire encoding.

Test the **HTTP request actually sent**, not only the MCP tool schema.

---

## 26.8 OpenAPI security posture

OpenAPI generation is a high-risk boundary because a model-facing parameter becomes part of an outbound HTTP request. The FastMCP project published security fixes in 2026 around OpenAPI-provider SSRF/path traversal behavior. Production policy should therefore include:

* pinning a patched current FastMCP 4 release and reviewing security notes before upgrades;
* restricting base URLs/origins;
* preventing user-controlled scheme/host changes;
* validating path parameters and normalizing URL joining;
* blocking internal metadata/link-local destinations unless explicitly needed;
* keeping admin/internal routes excluded;
* constraining redirects and proxy behavior;
* testing hostile path/query inputs.

Do not expose an arbitrary “URL” parameter just because an upstream OpenAPI description contains one. Review generated schemas as security-sensitive code.

---

## 26.9 `FastMCP.from_fastapi(...)`

FastAPI conversion is a convenience path built on OpenAPI generation:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastmcp import FastMCP

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/products/{product_id}")
async def get_product(product_id: int):
    return {"id": product_id}

mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(app=app)
```

The result is a normal `FastMCP` server, so handwritten MCP components can be added after conversion.

Use `from_fastapi` when:

* you own an existing FastAPI service and need a fast MCP bootstrap;
* the OpenAPI document is already a good description of endpoint schemas;
* you will curate the generated surface.

Do not use it as a reason to expose every operational endpoint to the model.

---

## 26.10 FastAPI conversion vs mounting FastMCP into FastAPI

These are opposite directions:

```text
FastMCP.from_fastapi(app)
    FastAPI/OpenAPI -> generated MCP components

fastapi_app.mount(..., mcp.http_app(...))
    FastMCP server -> mounted ASGI application inside FastAPI
```

They solve different problems and can even coexist.

### Existing API -> MCP

Use `from_fastapi`.

### Existing web service needs an MCP endpoint

Use `mcp.http_app()` and mount it into FastAPI; forward/merge FastMCP lifespan correctly (Section 19/20).

Agent rule: never substitute one for the other because both names mention FastAPI.

---

## 26.11 Generated schemas vs model-facing schemas

An OpenAPI operation can be syntactically correct yet poor for model use. Typical problems:

* implementation-shaped names (`post_v1_accounts_id_reconcile`);
* too many irrelevant parameters;
* undocumented enums;
* nested request objects with poor field descriptions;
* identical-looking endpoints that differ only subtly;
* administrative routes mixed with end-user operations;
* dozens/hundreds of tools competing for model attention.

Remedies:

```text
RouteMap exclusions
  + Namespace
  + ToolTransform (rename / description / argument shaping)
  + tags and visibility
  + ToolSearch / Code Mode for very large safe catalogs
  + handwritten facade tools for high-value workflows
```

The strongest pattern is often to treat generated components as a **low-level provider** and publish a curated higher-level surface above them.

---

## 26.12 Workflow facade pattern

Instead of exposing five REST endpoints as five unrelated tools:

```text
POST /draft
POST /validate
POST /approve
POST /commit
GET  /status
```

publish a deliberate workflow tool:

```python
@mcp.tool
def submit_order(order: OrderRequest) -> OrderResult:
    """Validate, submit, and return the accepted order state."""
    ...
```

Internally, the tool can use the same HTTP client/API. This yields:

* fewer model decisions;
* stronger transaction semantics;
* better validation;
* easier authorization;
* better error handling;
* a stable MCP contract even if REST endpoints change.

Generated OpenAPI tools remain useful as lower-level maintenance/debug capabilities if properly restricted.

---

## 26.13 Testing generated servers

Test both layers.

### MCP contract tests

```python
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client(mcp) as client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    assert all(t.name not in {"internal_reset", "admin_delete"} for t in tools)
```

### Upstream request tests

Mock or capture the HTTP request and assert:

```text
[ ] method correct
[ ] path variables encoded correctly
[ ] query encoding correct
[ ] headers contain only intended auth/context
[ ] body matches upstream schema
[ ] redirects/origins constrained
[ ] HTTP error mapped intentionally
```

### Security tests

Use hostile inputs for:

```text
../ traversal
absolute URL substitution
localhost / 127.0.0.1
link-local metadata addresses
encoded slashes / percent encoding
unexpected redirect target
oversized nested query parameters
```

---

## 26.14 Anti-pattern inventory

* Mirroring a 500-endpoint REST API into 500 model-visible tools and calling it finished.
* Forwarding every inbound Authorization/Cookie/header to the upstream API.
* Allowing tool arguments to replace the upstream host/scheme.
* Forgetting to exclude admin/internal operations.
* Treating ToolSearch as authorization.
* Confusing `from_fastapi()` with ASGI mounting.
* Relying only on MCP schema tests without checking emitted HTTP requests.
* Letting OpenAPI operation IDs become permanent public names without curation.
* Upgrading to v4 `httpx2` examples inside a project pinned to 3.4.x.
* Ignoring published provider security fixes and running a stale version.

---

## 26.15 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Decide whether generation is the final public surface or only a provider/bootstrap layer.
[ ] Use a client compatible with the pinned FastMCP major version.
[ ] Exclude internal/admin/destructive routes first.
[ ] Review RouteMap order.
[ ] Separate MCP caller auth from upstream API auth.
[ ] Never blindly forward arbitrary inbound headers.
[ ] Pin to a patched stable FastMCP release.
[ ] Test SSRF/path-traversal/redirect cases.
[ ] Curate names/descriptions/argument schemas for model use.
[ ] Use ToolSearch/Code Mode only after the catalog is safe.
[ ] Test actual outbound HTTP requests.
[ ] Prefer workflow facade tools for multi-endpoint business actions.

# FastMCP Advanced — 27) Project configuration, settings, and portable deployment contracts
### Project configuration, settings, and portable deployment contracts

**FastMCP 4 status.** Configuration remains layered across package/lockfile, project config, and `FASTMCP_*` settings. Include `FASTMCP_MCP_CAMELCASE_COMPAT` only as a migration shim, not a long-term API choice.


### 27.0 `fastmcp.json` as the canonical project contract

`fastmcp.json` is the **canonical and preferred** project-configuration format for FastMCP. The docs state that it provides a single portable source of truth for server settings, dependencies, and deployment options, replacing ad hoc command-line arguments and shell scripts. It is explicitly designed to be shareable across environments and teams. ([FastMCP][1])

The configuration model is intentionally tri-partite:

* **source** = where server code lives
* **environment** = what runtime/build environment the server requires
* **deployment** = how the server should run at execution time. ([FastMCP][1])

Minimal canonical shape:

```json id="bmo8q1"
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "type": "uv",
    "python": ">=3.10",
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "numpy"]
  },
  "deployment": {
    "transport": "stdio",
    "log_level": "INFO"
  }
}
```

Only `source` is required; `environment` and `deployment` are optional. ([FastMCP][1])

### 27.1 Why `fastmcp.json` should be the default project artifact

Use `fastmcp.json` whenever you want reproducible deployments, explicit dependency declarations, portable run/install behavior, and a stable handoff artifact between development, CI/CD, and end-user installation workflows. The docs explicitly tie the format to reproducible environments and to seamless use with `fastmcp run`, `install`, `inspect`, and related commands. ([FastMCP][1])

It is also the right format for local-to-production continuity because the same file can drive direct execution, installation into local MCP host clients, JSON config generation for unsupported clients, and prebuilt environment workflows. That makes it more than “configuration”; it is the deployment contract for the server. ([FastMCP][1])

### 27.2 `source`: where the server code lives

The `source` section is required. Today, the documented source type is `filesystem` (default), pointing at a local Python file with a FastMCP server instance or a zero-argument factory function. If `entrypoint` is omitted, FastMCP searches for common names such as `mcp`, `server`, or `app`. File paths are resolved relative to the configuration file’s location. The docs also note future planned source types like `git` and `cloud`, but those are not the currently supported contract. ([FastMCP][1])

Representative shape:

```json id="lh7yrm"
{
  "source": {
    "type": "filesystem",
    "path": "src/server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  }
}
```

Use an explicit `entrypoint` whenever the module exports more than one plausible server object or when you are using a factory function; rely on name inference only for simple one-server modules. That recommendation follows directly from the documented entrypoint-resolution behavior. ([FastMCP][1])

### 27.3 `environment`: what must exist to run the server

The `environment` section is the build-time environment contract. Current docs say FastMCP supports `uv` environments here, with fields for `python`, `dependencies`, `requirements`, `project`, and `editable`. When any UV-environment field is specified, FastMCP creates an isolated environment before running the server. ([FastMCP][1])

Documented UV fields:

* `python`: exact version or version constraint such as `"3.12"` or `">=3.10,<3.13"`
* `dependencies`: PEP 508 package strings
* `requirements`: requirements file path, resolved relative to the config file
* `project`: directory containing `pyproject.toml`
* `editable`: list of packages/directories to install in editable mode. ([FastMCP][1])

Representative shape:

```json id="acifjg"
{
  "environment": {
    "type": "uv",
    "python": ">=3.10",
    "dependencies": ["pandas>=2.0", "httpx"],
    "editable": ["."]
  }
}
```

This section is the correct place for dependency and interpreter requirements. Do not treat `fastmcp install` flags as the long-term source of truth when a project already has stable requirements; encode them here and let CLI operations consume the file. That is the model the docs promote. ([FastMCP][1])

### 27.4 `deployment`: how the server runs

The `deployment` section is the run-time execution contract. The docs define fields for `transport`, `host`, `port`, `path`, `log_level`, `env`, `cwd`, and `args`. Current documented transport values are `stdio`, `http`, and `sse`, with defaults of `stdio`, `127.0.0.1`, port `3000`, and path `/mcp/` in the config schema page. ([FastMCP][1])

Representative shape:

```json id="pnc6wg"
{
  "deployment": {
    "transport": "http",
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 3000,
    "path": "/api/mcp/",
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "env": {
      "ENV": "production",
      "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com"
    },
    "cwd": "/app",
    "args": ["--workers", "4"]
  }
}
```

`deployment.env` supports runtime interpolation of environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax; missing variables are left intact rather than failing expansion. The docs explicitly call out this pattern as useful for multi-environment deployments and for keeping sensitive values out of checked-in config files. ([FastMCP][1])

This section should be treated as **runtime behavior**, not package management. Build/install belongs in `environment`; process invocation shape belongs in `deployment`. The docs make that separation explicitly. ([FastMCP][1])

### 27.5 JSON-schema support for `fastmcp.json`

FastMCP publishes JSON Schemas for `fastmcp.json`, and the docs recommend adding `$schema` for IDE autocomplete and validation. Two schema URLs are documented: a version-specific URL and a rolling `latest.json` URL. ([FastMCP][1])

```json id="3m8jqk"
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  }
}
```

Use the version-specific schema in production repositories so validation stays stable across FastMCP upgrades; use `latest.json` only when you explicitly want the schema to track the newest format automatically. The docs list both URLs; the stability recommendation is the conservative interpretation of that dual-publishing model. ([FastMCP][1])

### 27.6 CLI overrides and precedence

CLI arguments override `fastmcp.json` values. The project-configuration docs show this explicitly for transport, port, and additional dependencies, and the utility layer exposes a `load_and_merge_config(...)` helper to merge config with CLI overrides across commands like `run`, `inspect`, and `dev`. ([FastMCP][1])

Representative examples from the documented precedence model:

```bash id="mxgsyn"
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --port 8080
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --transport http
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --with requests --with httpx
```

This precedence is what makes `fastmcp.json` viable as the canonical baseline while still allowing environment- or operator-specific overrides without editing the file. Treat the file as default truth and the CLI as ephemeral override. ([FastMCP][1])

### 27.7 Auto-detection and file naming

FastMCP auto-detects a file specifically named `fastmcp.json` in the current directory. Files with the same structure but different names are **not** auto-detected and must be passed explicitly. The docs show `fastmcp run` with no arguments relying on this exact filename rule. ([FastMCP][1])

```bash id="i0qko0"
cd my-project
fastmcp run              # auto-detects ./fastmcp.json
fastmcp run prod.fastmcp.json
```

That makes `fastmcp.json` not just a schema name but an operational convention. If you want zero-argument CLI ergonomics for a project, use that exact filename. ([FastMCP][1])

---

## 27.8 `fastmcp run`: operational entrypoint

`fastmcp run` starts a server or bridges to one. The CLI running docs say it accepts a Python file, explicit file/object entrypoint, factory function, remote URL, `fastmcp.json`, standard MCP config JSON, or no argument with `fastmcp.json` auto-detection. The lower-level CLI reference additionally documents module mode (`-m my_module`) and `--` passthrough of server arguments. ([FastMCP][2])

Representative target forms:

```bash id="kw4mbf"
fastmcp run server.py
fastmcp run server.py:my_server
fastmcp run server.py:create_server
fastmcp run https://example.com/mcp
fastmcp run fastmcp.json
fastmcp run mcp.json
fastmcp run -m my_module
fastmcp run server.py -- --config config.json --debug
```

Two operational details matter a lot:

1. By default, `fastmcp run` uses `stdio`; use `--transport http` or `--transport sse` to expose a network service. ([FastMCP][2])
2. `fastmcp run` **ignores** `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks. The docs explicitly say any setup logic there will not execute; if startup logic must run, expose a factory function and target that instead. ([FastMCP][2])

This makes factory functions the correct CLI entrypoint when initialization side effects, configuration bootstrapping, or async setup must happen before the server is returned. ([FastMCP][2])

### 27.8.1 Dependency-management behavior in `run`

The running docs say `fastmcp run` uses the current Python environment directly by default, but switches to `uv run` subprocess execution when flags like `--python`, `--with`, `--project`, or `--with-requirements` are present. In the `fastmcp.json` workflow, environment config can also trigger isolated-environment setup. The same docs and project-config docs document `--skip-env`, `--skip-source`, and `--project` for advanced environment control. ([FastMCP][2])

Use `--skip-env` when you already have a correct environment (activated venv, container image, prebuilt CI environment, or uv-managed project). Use `fastmcp project prepare` plus `--project` when you want install-once, run-many deployment behavior. ([FastMCP][1])

---

## 27.9 `fastmcp project prepare`: prebuilding reusable environments

Although not one of the user’s explicitly requested commands, `project prepare` belongs in the same operational layer because the `fastmcp.json` docs present it as the standard prebuild workflow. It creates a persistent uv project from `fastmcp.json`, installing dependencies ahead of time so later `fastmcp run ... --project <dir>` is fast and reproducible. The docs say the prepared directory contains `pyproject.toml`, `.venv`, and `uv.lock`. ([FastMCP][2])

```bash id="dn0jv8"
fastmcp project prepare fastmcp.json --output-dir ./env
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --project ./env
```

Use this in CI/CD, Docker image builds, and production deployments where dependency resolution at startup is undesirable. That recommendation follows directly from the docs’ “slow build, fast run” positioning. ([FastMCP][2])

---

## 27.10 `fastmcp install`: local-host installation and configuration generation

`fastmcp install` registers a local server with an MCP host application so the host can launch it automatically. The install docs say it is designed around local **stdio** servers and that each client runs servers in its own isolated environment, so dependencies must be declared explicitly rather than assumed from the local machine. `uv` must be available in `PATH`, and the docs call this out specifically for Claude Desktop and Cursor. ([FastMCP][3])

Supported install targets documented by FastMCP are:

* `claude-code`
* `claude-desktop`
* `cursor`
* `gemini-cli`
* `goose`
* `mcp-json`
* `stdio`. ([FastMCP][3])

Examples:

```bash id="3bj6gu"
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --with pandas --with matplotlib
fastmcp install cursor server.py -e .
fastmcp install claude-desktop fastmcp.json
```

The install surface also supports `--server-name`, `--with-editable`/`-e`, `--with`, `--env`, `--env-file`, `--python`, `--project`, `--with-requirements`, and (for `claude-desktop`) `--config-path`. Those flags are the correct way to declare isolated-host runtime dependencies and environment variables at install time when you are not using `fastmcp.json`. ([FastMCP][3])

The docs explicitly say `fastmcp install` is intended for **local** stdio servers. For remote HTTP servers, use the host client’s native configuration path instead; FastMCP’s install value is simplifying local `uv`/dependency/env setup. ([FastMCP][3])

### 27.10.1 `mcp-json` target

The `mcp-json` install target emits standard MCP configuration JSON instead of installing into a specific supported client. The install docs say this is useful for unsupported clients, CI/CD, or sharing portable server configs, and the integrations page defines the standard format as a `mcpServers` object with `command`, `args`, and optional `env`. ([FastMCP][3])

Representative output shape:

```json id="br8wu9"
{
  "server-name": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": ["run", "--with", "fastmcp", "fastmcp", "run", "/path/to/server.py"],
    "env": {
      "API_KEY": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

The docs also note `--copy` to send generated JSON to the clipboard instead of stdout. Use `mcp-json` when FastMCP does not have a first-class installer for the target client or when you need a raw config artifact for external systems. ([FastMCP][3])

### 27.10.2 `stdio` target

The `stdio` install target prints the exact shell command an MCP host would use to launch the server over standard I/O. The install docs show it emitting a `uv run ... fastmcp run ...` command, and when the source is `fastmcp.json`, documented dependencies from the config are automatically included. `--copy` also works here. ([FastMCP][3])

```bash id="x1qv7t"
fastmcp install stdio server.py
# -> uv run --with fastmcp fastmcp run /absolute/path/to/server.py

fastmcp install stdio fastmcp.json
# -> uv run --with fastmcp --with pillow --with 'qrcode[pil]>=8.0' fastmcp run /path/to/server.py
```

Use this target when you need the launch command for another wrapper, host, shell script, or deployment system, but not a client-specific install side effect. ([FastMCP][3])

---

## 27.11 `fastmcp inspect`: summary and machine-readable introspection

`fastmcp inspect` loads a server and reports its tools, resources, prompts, version, and metadata. By default it prints a human-readable summary; with `--format`, it emits JSON. The docs define two JSON output modes:

* `--format fastmcp`: full FastMCP metadata, `snake_case`, includes tool tags, enabled status, output schemas, annotations, and custom metadata
* `--format mcp`: protocol view, `camelCase`, only standard MCP fields. ([FastMCP][4])

```bash id="hdydub"
fastmcp inspect server.py
fastmcp inspect server.py --format fastmcp
fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp -o manifest.json
fastmcp inspect fastmcp.json
```

This split is extremely useful operationally. Use `fastmcp` format for internal debugging and full-framework introspection; use `mcp` format to verify exactly what external MCP clients will see. The docs explicitly present those as the two intended use cases. ([FastMCP][4])

The command supports the same local entrypoints as `fastmcp run`: inferred instances, explicit object selection, factory functions, and `fastmcp.json` configs. ([FastMCP][4])

---

## 27.12 `fastmcp generate-cli`: generated typed CLIs from tool schemas

`fastmcp generate-cli` is a v3 CLI feature that turns any server into a standalone typed Python CLI. The docs say it connects to a server, reads tool schemas, and writes a Python script where every tool becomes a real subcommand with typed flags, help text, and tab completion. It uses tool JSON Schema to derive the CLI contract. ([FastMCP][5])

Basic generation:

```bash id="4e5d6c"
fastmcp generate-cli weather
fastmcp generate-cli http://localhost:8000/mcp
fastmcp generate-cli server.py my_weather_cli.py
fastmcp generate-cli weather -f
```

The output path defaults to `cli.py`; `-f` overwrites an existing file. Generated scripts also include generic MCP operations—`list-tools`, `list-resources`, `read-resource`, `list-prompts`, and `get-prompt`—in addition to tool-specific subcommands. The docs emphasize that these generic operations reflect the server’s current state even if the server’s catalog changes after generation. ([FastMCP][5])

### 27.12.1 Typed parameter mapping

The docs define the schema-to-CLI mapping:

* simple JSON-schema types (`string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`) become typed flags
* arrays of simple types become repeatable flags
* complex types (objects, nested arrays, unions) become JSON-string arguments, with full schema shown in `--help`. ([FastMCP][5])

That makes the generated CLI notably stronger than generic `fastmcp call`. It is a **server-specific CLI surface** rather than a universal MCP inspector. Use it when the same server will be called repeatedly by humans or shell-capable agents. ([FastMCP][5])

### 27.12.2 Generated `SKILL.md`

Alongside the script, `generate-cli` writes a `SKILL.md` file. The docs define it as a Claude Code agent skill describing every tool’s exact invocation syntax, parameter flags, types, and descriptions, so an agent can use the CLI immediately without probing `--help`. `--no-skill` disables this generation. ([FastMCP][5])

```bash id="jgv9hl"
fastmcp generate-cli weather --no-skill
```

This is particularly valuable for agentic workflows because the generated CLI plus `SKILL.md` becomes a compact operational bundle: executable client + machine-readable usage manual. ([FastMCP][5])

### 27.12.3 Generated CLI architecture

The generated script is a **client**, not a packaged server wrapper. The docs say it reconnects to the target server on every invocation and stores the resolved transport in a `CLIENT_SPEC` variable at the top of the file. For generated scripts from local servers, that may be a baked-in `StdioTransport`; for remote targets, it may be a URL string. The docs also note that the script requires `fastmcp` as a dependency and can be run with `uv run --with fastmcp ...` when outside an existing FastMCP environment. ([FastMCP][5])

That makes generated CLIs easy to retarget: change `CLIENT_SPEC` to move from dev to prod, or from local subprocess to remote HTTP, without regenerating the whole wrapper. ([FastMCP][5])

---

## 27.13 `fastmcp.json` vs standard MCP JSON

These are different artifacts and should not be conflated.

* `fastmcp.json` is FastMCP’s **project/deployment contract**: source, environment, deployment, CLI auto-detection, and prebuild workflows. ([FastMCP][1])
* standard MCP JSON (`mcpServers` with `command` / `args` / `env`) is the **client-install/launch contract** understood by host applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code. ([FastMCP][6])

Use `fastmcp.json` inside your project as the canonical source of truth. Generate or install standard MCP JSON only at the boundary where an external MCP host needs to know how to launch the server. That is the architecture implied by the docs’ separation of these two formats. ([FastMCP][1])

---

## 27.14 Best-practice operational guidance

Use `fastmcp.json` as the default checked-in project artifact. Put dependency and runtime defaults there, then layer CLI overrides for one-off tests or environment-specific adjustments. ([FastMCP][1])

Prefer `fastmcp run fastmcp.json` or zero-argument `fastmcp run` in project directories over hand-maintained shell scripts, because the config file centralizes source lookup, environment setup, and deployment behavior. ([FastMCP][1])

Use `fastmcp project prepare` plus `fastmcp run ... --project ...` for production pipelines, container builds, and CI/CD when cold-start dependency resolution is undesirable. ([FastMCP][1])

Use `fastmcp install` for local stdio-host integration into Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or Goose; use `mcp-json` or native client config for unsupported clients or automation; use `stdio` target when you want the exact launch command instead of installation side effects. ([FastMCP][3])

Use `fastmcp inspect --format fastmcp` for full-framework introspection and `--format mcp` for protocol-surface verification. Use `fastmcp generate-cli` when repeated operator/agent use justifies a server-specific typed CLI and accompanying `SKILL.md`. ([FastMCP][4])

# FastMCP Advanced — 28) CLI and developer workflows
### CLI and developer workflows

**FastMCP 4 status.** CLI workflows remain, but live operations now encounter protocol negotiation. Treat a local script path as a path, not an ambiguous string, and test modern/legacy behavior where interactivity matters.


### 28.0 CLI mental model

The `fastmcp` CLI is not only a server launcher. In the stable v3 line it covers four workflow families:

```text
build/run        -> run, dev
inspect/test     -> inspect, list, call
package/install  -> install, generate-cli
discover/manage  -> discover, version/auth helpers
```

Use these commands to keep the MCP protocol surface observable outside your Python process. The CLI is especially valuable for LLM coding agents because it gives deterministic shell-level checks of what the server actually publishes.

---

## 28.1 Command map

| Command | Primary use |
| --- | --- |
| `fastmcp version` | Verify installed FastMCP/MCP environment |
| `fastmcp run ...` | Run a server target over chosen transport |
| `fastmcp dev ...` | Developer tooling, including Inspector/Apps preview |
| `fastmcp inspect ...` | Load local server and emit human or JSON manifest |
| `fastmcp list ...` | List remote/local MCP components through the client path |
| `fastmcp call ...` | Invoke a tool, read a resource, or render a prompt |
| `fastmcp discover` | Find servers configured in supported local MCP hosts |
| `fastmcp generate-cli ...` | Generate a typed standalone client CLI for one server |
| `fastmcp install ...` | Register a server into supported MCP client applications |

Exact options can evolve; use `fastmcp <command> --help` against the pinned installed version as the call-signature source.

---

## 28.2 `fastmcp run`: reproducible local/server launch

```bash
fastmcp run server.py
fastmcp run server.py:mcp
fastmcp run fastmcp.json
fastmcp run server.py --transport http
```

Use explicit entrypoints when a module contains multiple server-like objects or factories. Prefer `fastmcp.json` for projects with nontrivial environment/deployment configuration because it becomes a portable execution contract rather than a long shell command.

### Environment isolation

FastMCP CLI workflows integrate tightly with `uv` so a server can run with declared Python/dependency requirements. Treat CLI dependency flags as a development convenience; promote durable dependency requirements into `pyproject.toml`, lockfiles, and/or `fastmcp.json` for reproducible CI/production.

---

## 28.3 Development preview

Two high-value dev loops are:

```bash
# Protocol-oriented development / Inspector workflow
fastmcp dev server.py

# Apps browser preview / host simulation
fastmcp dev apps server.py
```

The Apps preview lets you exercise renderer behavior without first configuring a full external MCP host. Still validate against the actual target host before release because host implementation/capability differences remain real.

---

## 28.4 `fastmcp inspect`: definition-time manifest

```bash
fastmcp inspect server.py
fastmcp inspect server.py --format fastmcp
fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp -o mcp-manifest.json
```

Two views matter:

* **FastMCP format** — framework metadata such as tags, versions, output schemas, visibility-related data, and FastMCP-specific fields.
* **MCP format** — protocol-facing representation clients actually receive.

Use the MCP-format manifest as a compatibility artifact. Use the FastMCP format for debugging framework-specific publication state.

Important: `inspect` is a **local loading** workflow. It is not a remote URL introspector. Use the client-facing `list`/`call` commands for live remote servers.

---

## 28.5 `fastmcp list`: live catalog inspection

Representative usage:

```bash
fastmcp list server.py
fastmcp list https://example.com/mcp
fastmcp list my-configured-server
```

Use `list` when you want the view after transport, initialization, auth, provider aggregation, transforms, visibility, and protocol listing behavior—not merely the Python definition.

This distinction is crucial in debugging:

```text
inspect says tool exists
but live list does not
    -> investigate auth, visibility, transport, session transform, provider init
```

---

## 28.6 `fastmcp call`: protocol smoke test

```bash
fastmcp call server.py add a=2 b=3
fastmcp call https://example.com/mcp get_weather city=London
fastmcp call server.py resource://config
fastmcp call server.py summarize --prompt topic=weather
```

Useful options include raw JSON output, explicit transport, auth, timeout, input JSON, and prompt mode.

### JSON argument rule

Simple values can often be supplied as `key=value`; complex nested arguments are more robust through `--input-json`.

```bash
fastmcp call server.py create_user \
  --input-json '{"name":"Ada","roles":["admin","analyst"]}'
```

Use raw JSON output in CI so assertions operate on structure rather than colored human text.

---

## 28.7 Interactive elicitation through the CLI

For v3-era server-initiated elicitation, the CLI client can prompt in the terminal when a tool requests additional user input. This makes `fastmcp call` useful for exercising interactive tool paths without an LLM host.

Do not assume that because CLI elicitation works, every target client supports the same interaction. Client capability checks still matter.

FastMCP 4 changes the modern-protocol elicitation model; see Section 36 rather than applying v4 interaction semantics to this stable v3 reference.

---

## 28.8 `fastmcp discover`: find configured local servers

```bash
fastmcp discover
fastmcp discover --source claude-code
```

The CLI can inspect common host configuration locations such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Goose, and project MCP JSON configuration.

Use this for:

* inventorying local development MCP servers;
* finding the command/config a host is actually launching;
* diagnosing “works manually, fails in editor” mismatches;
* migration audits across hosts.

Do not treat discovery output as a security inventory of remote infrastructure; it is a local configuration-discovery feature.

---

## 28.9 `fastmcp install`: host configuration generation

Representative commands:

```bash
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --with pandas
fastmcp install cursor server.py --with-editable .
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py
fastmcp install stdio server.py
```

Supported clients/options can vary by FastMCP version. The important architecture is that `install` translates a FastMCP server target plus environment requirements into the configuration format or registration mechanism expected by the target MCP host.

### Isolation rule

Desktop/editor hosts frequently launch STDIO servers in an isolated environment. Never assume the host inherits the Python virtual environment from the shell where you developed the server. Declare dependencies explicitly.

---

## 28.10 `fastmcp generate-cli`: freeze server schemas into a typed operator CLI

```bash
fastmcp generate-cli weather
fastmcp generate-cli http://localhost:8000/mcp weather_cli.py
```

The generator connects to the server, reads tool schemas, and emits a Python CLI where tool operations become typed subcommands/flags. It also includes generic list/resource/prompt operations so the script remains useful as server state evolves.

The generator also emits an agent-oriented `SKILL.md` by default, documenting the exact invocation syntax. This is particularly useful when a coding agent should interact with a service through a narrow generated command surface instead of constructing MCP calls ad hoc.

### Drift warning

Generated typed tool subcommands reflect the schema at generation time. If the server contract changes, regenerate and review the CLI. Generic operations still query current server state, but a generated tool subcommand is a code artifact that can go stale.

---

## 28.11 CLI in CI/CD

Recommended pipeline:

```bash
# 1. import / server construction smoke check
fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp -o current-mcp.json

# 2. compare manifest / fingerprint baseline
python scripts/check_contract.py current-mcp.json

# 3. launch test server (or use in-memory tests separately)
# 4. execute protocol smoke calls
fastmcp call server.py health --json

# 5. package/build/deploy
```

For remote staging:

```bash
fastmcp list https://staging.example.com/mcp
fastmcp call https://staging.example.com/mcp health --json
```

Add auth options/credentials through secure CI secret injection rather than command history or committed shell scripts.

---

## 28.12 Debugging decision tree

```text
Server won't import
  -> python import / fastmcp inspect

Server imports but host can't launch STDIO
  -> fastmcp run + inspect host config + dependency/env isolation

Remote HTTP connection fails
  -> fastmcp list URL + auth + proxy/Host/Origin/TLS checks

Tool missing
  -> inspect local -> list live -> visibility/auth/provider/transform diff

Tool schema wrong
  -> inspect --format mcp + tool fingerprint / type annotations

Tool executes wrong
  -> fastmcp call with --json + server logs/traces

App doesn't render
  -> fastmcp dev apps -> target host capability test
```

---

## 28.13 Shell/STDIO logging invariant

STDIO transport uses standard input/output as the protocol stream. Do not print arbitrary debug text to stdout in an STDIO server.

Use:

* Python logging to stderr;
* FastMCP `Context` logging to the client when appropriate;
* structured telemetry;
* explicit debug files/traces.

A stray `print()` can corrupt the protocol stream and create misleading client failures.

---

## 28.14 Anti-pattern inventory

* Running `python server.py` manually in one environment and assuming Claude/Cursor launches the same environment.
* Using only `inspect` to diagnose a live authenticated remote server.
* Parsing human CLI text in CI when JSON output exists.
* Committing bearer tokens in install commands/config files.
* Treating a generated CLI as permanently synchronized with a changing server.
* Printing logs to stdout in STDIO mode.
* Using `fastmcp dev` behavior as proof of production host compatibility.
* Keeping a 20-flag `fastmcp run` shell command instead of a portable config artifact.

---

## 28.15 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Use fastmcp version to record the actual runtime version.
[ ] Use inspect for local definition manifests.
[ ] Use list/call for live protocol behavior.
[ ] Prefer JSON output for automation.
[ ] Test both STDIO and HTTP when both are deployment targets.
[ ] Declare dependencies for host-installed STDIO servers.
[ ] Use fastmcp.json for portable nontrivial server configuration.
[ ] Regenerate typed CLIs after schema changes.
[ ] Keep credentials out of shell history/repository files.
[ ] Never write arbitrary stdout logs in STDIO mode.

### Observability, inspection, telemetry, and operational diagnostics

**FastMCP 4 status.** Telemetry emits one SERVER span per request under the v4 engine and includes protocol-version context. Distinguish protocol era in operational dashboards when debugging behavior differences.


### 29.0 Operational framing

This section is the operational closure of the reference set: how to observe a running FastMCP system, verify the server surface before clients see it, test it without accidental transport or environment drift, and harden the deployment with explicit production defaults. FastMCP’s own docs cover these as separate surfaces—native OpenTelemetry instrumentation, `fastmcp inspect`, a dedicated testing guide, transport guidance, app versioning cautions, response-caching caveats, task-backend recommendations, and tool-catalog search transforms. Collapsing them into one ops section is the right final-layer mental model. ([FastMCP][1])

### 29.1 Built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation

FastMCP includes native OpenTelemetry instrumentation by default. The telemetry docs say instrumentation is always active, creates spans for tool, prompt, resource, and resource-template operations, adds no overhead when no OpenTelemetry SDK is configured, and works with any OTLP-compatible backend because FastMCP uses the OpenTelemetry API and expects you to bring your own SDK/exporter/sampling policy. ([FastMCP][1])

The documented “fastest path” to exported traces is auto-instrumentation with `opentelemetry-instrument`: install `opentelemetry-distro` plus an OTLP exporter, run `opentelemetry-bootstrap -a install`, then launch the server under `opentelemetry-instrument fastmcp run server.py`, optionally setting `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` by environment variable. The docs explicitly say this works without changing your FastMCP code. ([FastMCP][1])

Programmatic SDK setup is also supported, but the telemetry docs are explicit that the tracer provider must be configured **before importing FastMCP** so FastMCP initializes against the intended provider. That import-order rule is the most important implementation detail for code-based telemetry bootstrapping. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="d8plhm"
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

provider = TracerProvider()
provider.add_span_processor(
    BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4317"))
)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("my-server")
```

### 29.2 Span model: what FastMCP traces by default

The telemetry docs define server spans for the core MCP operations using names like `tools/call {name}`, `resources/read {uri}`, and `prompts/get {name}`. The same page says the FastMCP client generates outgoing spans using the same naming pattern, which gives you end-to-end request visibility across client and server. ([FastMCP][1])

Mounted composition and proxying show up in the trace tree. For mounted child servers, the docs say FastMCP inserts an additional `delegate {name}` span so the handoff to the child server is visible. For proxy providers, the documented span hierarchy shows the proxy-provider server span and then continuation into remote-server spans through trace-context propagation. That means provider composition is visible in traces by design, not hidden behind a monolithic “tool call” span. ([FastMCP][1])

The telemetry page also documents FastMCP-specific attributes such as `fastmcp.server.name`, `fastmcp.component.type`, `fastmcp.component.key`, `fastmcp.provider.type`, and provider-delegation attributes like `fastmcp.delegate.original_name` / `fastmcp.delegate.original_uri` and `fastmcp.proxy.backend_name` / `fastmcp.proxy.backend_uri`. These are the attributes to key on when building dashboards for composition-heavy servers. ([FastMCP][1])

### 29.3 Custom spans and error behavior

FastMCP exposes `fastmcp.telemetry.get_tracer()` so application code can create custom spans inside tools or other server components. The telemetry docs show this explicitly and use it to wrap internal phases like parsing and processing while attaching custom attributes. That is the correct way to enrich traces with domain-specific timing without replacing FastMCP’s built-in spans. ([FastMCP][1])

```python id="jvj7m5"
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.telemetry import get_tracer

mcp = FastMCP("custom-spans")

@mcp.tool()
async def complex_operation(input: str) -> str:
    tracer = get_tracer()

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("parse_input") as span:
        span.set_attribute("input.length", len(input))
        parsed = parse(input)

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_data") as span:
        span.set_attribute("data.count", len(parsed))
        result = process(parsed)

    return result
```

Error recording is automatic. The telemetry docs say when a tool raises, the span is marked with `ERROR` status and an exception event with stack trace is recorded. That makes built-in tracing enough to answer “what failed, where, and under which request/component/provider path?” even before adding custom span logic. ([FastMCP][1])

### 29.4 Telemetry testing

FastMCP documents an explicit telemetry-testing pattern using OpenTelemetry’s in-memory exporter. The page shows a pytest fixture that installs a `TracerProvider` with `SimpleSpanProcessor(InMemorySpanExporter())`, swaps it into `trace.set_tracer_provider(...)`, and then asserts against spans generated by a real FastMCP call. This is the correct test style when you need deterministic assertions over span names, status, and attributes without standing up Jaeger, Tempo, or OTLP collectors. ([FastMCP][1])

Use the in-memory exporter for unit tests that verify trace creation, naming, and error marking. Use a real collector only for integration smoke tests covering exporter wiring, collector reachability, and backend-specific dashboards. The docs do not state that recommendation verbatim, but it follows directly from their in-memory-exporter fixture for tests and OTLP collector guidance for runtime export. ([FastMCP][1])

### 29.5 CLI inspection as the primary schema/manifest verification tool

`fastmcp inspect` is the core inspection and manifest-verification command. The CLI docs say it supports the same **local** entrypoint forms as `fastmcp run`—inferred instance, explicit `file.py:object`, factory function, and `fastmcp.json`—but does **not** inspect remote URLs or generic MCP config files. That means `inspect` is for verifying a server definition you control locally, not for interrogating arbitrary remote MCP services. ([FastMCP][2])

The most important inspection split is output format. `--format fastmcp` emits the full FastMCP-specific manifest, including tags, enabled state, annotations, custom metadata, and output schemas. `--format mcp` emits the protocol view—the exact standard MCP fields clients will see, in camelCase, without FastMCP-only extras. The docs explicitly position `fastmcp` format for internal introspection/debugging and `mcp` format for client-visibility and compatibility verification. ([FastMCP][3])

```bash id="mokczt"
fastmcp inspect server.py
fastmcp inspect server.py --format fastmcp
fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp -o manifest.json
fastmcp inspect fastmcp.json
```

Operationally, this gives you two verification gates:

* **full-framework manifest verification** with `--format fastmcp`
* **wire-surface verification** with `--format mcp`

Run both in CI when schema drift matters. The docs’ format split is exactly what makes this two-layer verification possible. ([FastMCP][3])

### 29.6 Schema verification in tests

FastMCP’s testing guide explicitly recommends inline snapshots for complex data structures and calls out JSON schemas and API responses as prime use cases. The page shows `inline-snapshot` being used to pin an expected schema shape and says `pytest --inline-snapshot=create` populates empty snapshots while `pytest --inline-snapshot=fix` updates them intentionally. This is the most direct documented pattern for guarding against accidental schema or manifest drift. ([FastMCP][4])

That suggests a clean test strategy:

* use `fastmcp inspect --format mcp` in CI for whole-server manifest verification
* use inline snapshots in unit tests for per-component schema/output verification. ([FastMCP][3])

### 29.7 Testing strategy: in-memory first

FastMCP’s testing docs say **in-memory transport** should cover most unit-testing needs. Pass the server instance directly to `Client(server)`, run everything in the same process, and test real MCP protocol behavior without network overhead. The docs explicitly describe this as deterministic, fast, and debugger-friendly, with typical completion in milliseconds. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="kxjlwm"
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

server = FastMCP("WeatherServer")

@server.tool
def get_temperature(city: str) -> dict:
    temps = {"NYC": 72, "LA": 85, "Chicago": 68}
    return {"city": city, "temp": temps.get(city, 70)}

async def test_weather_operations():
    async with Client(server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("get_temperature", {"city": "NYC"})
        assert result.data == {"city": "NYC", "temp": 72}
```

For most application code, this should be the default test harness. Reach for network transports only when you need to verify actual HTTP/SSE transport behavior, reverse-proxy assumptions, auth headers, or process/isolation semantics. That recommendation is a direct reading of the test guide’s “in-memory covers most unit testing” statement. ([FastMCP][4])

### 29.8 Testing network transports

When you do need real transport coverage, FastMCP’s testing guide says the preferred approach is **in-process async network testing** with `run_server_async(...)`. The docs explicitly call this preferred over subprocess testing because it is faster, deterministic, and gives better debugger/error behavior. ([FastMCP][4])

```python id="hvz3zc"
import pytest
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport
from fastmcp.utilities.tests import run_server_async

def create_test_server() -> FastMCP:
    server = FastMCP("TestServer")

    @server.tool
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    return server

@pytest.fixture
async def http_server() -> str:
    server = create_test_server()
    async with run_server_async(server) as url:
        yield url

async def test_http_transport(http_server: str):
    async with Client(transport=StreamableHttpTransport(http_server)) as client:
        assert await client.ping() is True
        greeting = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
        assert greeting.data == "Hello, World!"
```

Use subprocess testing only for the cases the docs call out as special: STDIO transport itself, full process isolation, or subprocess-specific behavior. The test guide explicitly treats subprocess transport tests as a separate, heavier class of tests. ([FastMCP][4])

### 29.9 General testing discipline from the FastMCP docs

FastMCP’s test guide is unusually prescriptive, and the recommendations are worth carrying over directly into application codebases. The page says tests should generally complete in under one second unless marked as integration tests; every test should be self-contained; fixtures should not open FastMCP clients because that can create difficult event-loop issues; and good tests verify one behavior clearly rather than many unrelated behaviors at once. ([FastMCP][4])

The same page also demonstrates auth testing by pairing a protected server with `Client(..., auth=BearerAuth(...))`, which is the right pattern when validating authentication-dependent behavior without needing a full external identity provider. Use that pattern for auth unit tests, and reserve full OAuth/browser/callback tests for higher-level integration suites. ([FastMCP][4])

### 29.10 Production checklist

Treat the following as the baseline production hardening checklist for FastMCP:

* **Prefer Streamable HTTP over SSE** for new deployments. The running and client-transport docs both explicitly say SSE is only for backward compatibility and that Streamable HTTP is the recommended path for new HTTP deployments. ([FastMCP][5])
* **Keep `mcp.run()` under `if __name__ == "__main__":`** in ordinary server scripts. The running guide explicitly calls this best practice for compatibility so the server starts only when the script is executed directly, not when imported. ([FastMCP][5])
* **Pin `prefab-ui` for app deployments.** The Apps overview explicitly says FastMCP intentionally does not pin an upper bound for `prefab-ui`, that Prefab changes rapidly, and that production deployments must pin a specific version themselves. ([FastMCP][6])
* **Do not apply naive response caching to auth/session-derived results.** The middleware docs explicitly warn that cache keys are based only on operation name and arguments, not on user or session identity, so tools whose effective results depend on auth headers or session state should not be cached unless identity is part of the arguments. ([FastMCP][7])
* **Use Redis/Valkey for durable or scaled background-task deployments.** The background-task docs explicitly recommend Redis (or Valkey) for production because tasks survive restarts, pickup latency is much lower, and additional workers can scale across processes or machines. ([FastMCP][8])
* **Use ToolSearch when very large tool catalogs would waste context tokens and hurt tool selection.** The ToolSearch docs explicitly say large catalogs waste tokens and degrade tool-selection accuracy, and that the transform replaces a full tool dump with `search_tools` plus `call_tool` so tools are discovered on demand instead of loaded wholesale into context. ([FastMCP][9])
* **Use in-memory transport for most unit tests and `run_server_async(...)` for most network-transport tests.** FastMCP’s testing docs explicitly describe these as the preferred default patterns. ([FastMCP][4])
* **Use `fastmcp inspect --format mcp` as the final “what will clients actually see?” gate.** The inspect docs explicitly define MCP format as the exact protocol view, distinct from the richer FastMCP internal format. ([FastMCP][3])
* **Enable OpenTelemetry export in production rather than relying on no-op instrumentation.** FastMCP instrumentation is always present but only emits spans when an SDK/exporter is configured; the docs explicitly recommend `opentelemetry-instrument` or programmatic SDK setup. ([FastMCP][1])

### 29.11 Closing operational pattern

A practical production loop, directly supported by the docs, is: define the server; verify the public surface with `fastmcp inspect --format mcp`; test behavior primarily with in-memory clients and secondarily with `run_server_async(...)`; run under Streamable HTTP; enable OpenTelemetry export; pin UI dependencies if apps are present; keep response caching limited to identity-stable operations; and move background tasks onto Redis/Valkey before you care about durability or scale. ([FastMCP][3])

If you want, I can now produce the appendix/reference unit next: decorator-argument matrices, DI injection matrix, task-mode truth tables, provider/transform comparison grids, client transport/auth decision matrices, and output-schema/content-block conversion cheat sheets.

# FastMCP Advanced — 30) Testing, contract verification, and tool fingerprinting
### Testing, contract verification, and tool fingerprinting

**FastMCP 4 status.** Contract tests should disable camelCase compatibility in at least one CI job and assert snake_case model access. Add modern/legacy protocol-mode cases for interactive/stateful servers.


### 30.0 Testing model

A production FastMCP server has multiple contracts. Test all of them separately:

```text
Python declaration contract
  -> server-resolution contract
      -> MCP protocol contract
          -> transport/auth/session contract
              -> side-effect/business contract
```

A unit test that calls the underlying Python function proves only the last layer of local business logic. It does **not** prove schema generation, dependency injection, middleware, provider transforms, visibility, auth, transport initialization, or MCP result conversion.

---

## 30.1 Test pyramid

| Layer | Recommended technique | Catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pure domain | Ordinary pytest unit tests | Business logic, edge cases |
| Component declaration | `mcp.get_tool`, resource/prompt lookup | Metadata, version, generated schema |
| In-memory MCP | `Client(mcp)` | Full MCP request pipeline without network |
| Manifest | `fastmcp inspect --format mcp` | Published protocol contract drift |
| Transport integration | STDIO/HTTP test server | Serialization, process/network lifecycle |
| Auth/security | HTTP client with tokens/claims | Authentication and authorization policy |
| Host/App | Real target client / Apps preview | Host-specific capabilities and UI |

---

## 30.2 In-memory client is the default integration test primitive

```python
import pytest
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Calculator")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_add_over_mcp():
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 2, "b": 3})
        assert result.data == 5
```

This exercises:

* generated tool schema;
* argument validation;
* FastMCP call routing;
* sync/async execution adaptation;
* result serialization;
* client result parsing.

Use direct function tests **in addition** to this, not instead of it.

---

## 30.3 Catalog tests

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_catalog():
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        names = {t.name for t in tools}
        assert "add" in names
        assert "internal_debug" not in names
```

Catalog tests should verify:

```text
[ ] expected public components exist
[ ] internal/app-only components do not leak
[ ] namespaces are correct
[ ] highest intended version is selected
[ ] disabled versions fall back as intended
[ ] auth-filtered tools appear/disappear for the right principal
[ ] search transforms expose only the intended discovery tools
```

---

## 30.4 Schema assertions

Inspect the protocol-facing representation, not an internal Pydantic model alone.

Conceptual server-side path:

```python
async def get_protocol_tool(server: FastMCP, name: str):
    tool = await server.get_tool(name)
    assert tool is not None
    return tool.to_mcp_tool()
```

Validate:

* required argument list;
* enum/literal values;
* field descriptions;
* defaults;
* array/object structure;
* `outputSchema` where relied upon;
* annotations that influence routing/safety UX;
* version/name identity.

---

## 30.5 Tool fingerprinting: stable contract hash recipe

FastMCP deliberately does not prescribe a single universal hash because different applications care about different metadata. It exposes the pieces needed to build one:

```text
tool.key          -> canonical FastMCP component identity (type/name/version)
tool.to_mcp_tool  -> protocol-facing object clients receive
```

Reference implementation:

```python
import hashlib
import json
from fastmcp import FastMCP

async def fingerprint_tool(server: FastMCP, tool_name: str) -> str:
    tool = await server.get_tool(tool_name)
    if tool is None:
        raise KeyError(tool_name)

    wire = tool.to_mcp_tool().model_dump(
        mode="json",
        by_alias=True,
        exclude_none=True,
    )

    payload = {
        "key": tool.key,
        "inputSchema": wire["inputSchema"],
        "outputSchema": wire.get("outputSchema"),
    }

    canonical = json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
    return hashlib.sha256(canonical.encode()).hexdigest()
```

The inclusion policy is yours.

---

## 30.6 What belongs in a fingerprint?

| Field | Include when |
| --- | --- |
| `tool.key` | Always; captures type/name/version identity |
| `inputSchema` | Always for callable contract drift |
| `outputSchema` | Downstream code validates structured results |
| `description` | Tool selection/routing behavior depends on wording |
| `annotations` | Read-only/destructive/idempotent hints drive policy |
| `_meta` | Custom metadata participates in authorization/routing |
| tags | Publication/policy systems consume tags |
| icons/title | Usually exclude unless UI compatibility is contract-critical |

Do not hash volatile runtime values such as timestamps or deployment IDs into a contract fingerprint.

---

## 30.7 Manifest generation

```python
async def tool_manifest(server: FastMCP) -> dict[str, str]:
    result = {}
    for tool in await server.list_tools():
        result[tool.key] = await fingerprint_tool(server, tool.name)
    return result
```

Store the manifest as a CI artifact:

```json
{
  "tool:add@1.0": "1c2d...",
  "tool:lookup_customer@2.1": "c9e4..."
}
```

Review changes rather than blindly accepting them.

---

## 30.8 Drift classification

Not all changes have the same risk.

| Change | Typical risk |
| --- | --- |
| add optional parameter with safe default | low/medium |
| change description only | routing behavior can change even if schema-compatible |
| make optional parameter required | breaking |
| rename parameter | breaking |
| narrow enum | breaking for callers using removed value |
| widen enum | usually compatible, but downstream validation may differ |
| change output object shape | potentially breaking |
| bump tool version and keep old version | migration-friendly |
| remove tool/version | breaking for callers pinned to it |

Treat model-facing description changes as real behavior changes even when traditional API compatibility tooling would ignore them.

---

## 30.9 Snapshot testing protocol manifests

`fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp` gives a protocol-oriented manifest suitable for snapshot/golden testing.

```bash
fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp -o current.json
python scripts/compare_manifest.py baseline.json current.json
```

Keep snapshots deterministic:

* canonicalize JSON ordering;
* ignore known volatile metadata;
* pin FastMCP version;
* pin provider/generated-spec inputs;
* separate expected schema changes from incidental dependency drift.

---

## 30.10 Version behavior tests

For multiple tool versions:

```python
@mcp.tool(name="search", version="1.0")
def search_v1(query: str): ...

@mcp.tool(name="search", version="2.0")
def search_v2(query: str, limit: int = 20): ...
```

Test:

```text
default lookup -> 2.0
explicit version 1.0 -> v1 implementation
v2 disabled -> default falls back to enabled v1
unknown explicit version -> not found/error
```

Do the same for versioned prompts/resources when they are part of your compatibility strategy.

---

## 30.11 Visibility and authorization matrix tests

A useful fixture matrix:

| Principal/session | Expected catalog |
| --- | --- |
| anonymous | public read-only tools |
| standard user | public + user-scoped tools |
| admin | admin tools additionally visible |
| app renderer | app-visible backend tools only as intended |
| search-mode client | search/execute meta-tools, not giant raw catalog |

Test both:

1. **listing visibility**;
2. **direct call enforcement**.

A hidden tool that remains callable without authorization is not protected; a visible tool that is denied at execution may be acceptable depending on UX but should be intentional.

---

## 30.12 Middleware tests

Create a trace list in a test middleware and assert ordering:

```text
outer before
  inner before
    handler
  inner after
outer after
```

Test exception paths too. Error middleware that only works on successful responses is not an error middleware.

For caching middleware, specifically test identity-sensitive operations: two users calling the same operation with the same arguments must never receive each other's result if the cache key does not incorporate identity.

---

## 30.13 Context/DI tests

Test that runtime-only dependencies:

* are absent from the MCP schema;
* resolve exactly once per request where caching is intended;
* clean up context-manager dependencies;
* see the correct access token/request/server;
* fail clearly when used outside a request.

A schema regression test should explicitly ensure secrets/DB session parameters never become model-visible.

---

## 30.14 Background task tests

Test the full state machine:

```text
submit -> task id
status -> queued/running
progress -> monotonic/meaningful
result -> final value
cancel -> cancelled where supported
worker restart -> durability behavior matches backend design
```

Do not test only the task function directly. The task transport/result lifecycle is the feature.

---

## 30.15 Transport parity tests

When you support more than one transport, run the same contract suite through:

```text
in-memory
STDIO
Streamable HTTP
```

This catches:

* stdout contamination;
* process environment differences;
* URL/path/mount mistakes;
* auth-only-on-HTTP assumptions;
* lifespan/session differences;
* reverse-proxy metadata issues.

SSE should only be in the matrix when you intentionally support legacy clients.

---

## 30.16 OpenAPI/generated-provider tests

For generated components, pin the source spec and verify:

```text
route count
excluded operation ids
public tool names
input schemas
outbound URL/method/query/body
auth header mapping
error conversion
SSRF/path traversal cases
```

A changed upstream OpenAPI document is an MCP contract change even when no FastMCP Python source changed.

---

## 30.17 Apps tests

Beyond the tool result:

```text
[ ] app metadata links to a ui:// renderer
[ ] structuredContent is serializable
[ ] app-only backend tools are not model-visible
[ ] namespacing does not break backend calls
[ ] unauthorized backend action denied
[ ] file upload scope stable in target deployment mode
[ ] custom CSP/permissions correct
```

Run browser/host-level tests for critical UIs; in-memory MCP alone cannot prove iframe rendering behavior.

---

## 30.18 Production smoke tests

After deployment:

```bash
fastmcp list https://staging.example.com/mcp
fastmcp call https://staging.example.com/mcp health --json
```

Also verify:

* OAuth discovery endpoints;
* token audience/issuer handling;
* mounted path correctness;
* Host/Origin behavior behind the real proxy;
* stream buffering disabled where needed;
* task/event-store backend reachable.

---

## 30.19 Anti-pattern inventory

* Testing only decorated Python functions directly.
* Snapshotting internal Python object reprs instead of MCP wire models.
* Ignoring descriptions because “only schemas matter.”
* Hashing unsorted JSON and calling it a stable fingerprint.
* Accepting manifest drift automatically in CI.
* Testing catalog visibility but not direct authorization.
* Testing auth only in-memory when production auth exists only over HTTP.
* Testing Apps only as JSON and never in the target host.
* Treating an OpenAPI spec update as non-code/non-contract change.

---

## 30.20 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Unit-test domain functions separately from MCP integration.
[ ] Make Client(mcp) the default MCP integration-test path.
[ ] Snapshot/inspect the protocol-facing manifest.
[ ] Fingerprint tool.key + selected wire fields deterministically.
[ ] Classify contract drift by compatibility risk.
[ ] Test versions, visibility, and auth matrices.
[ ] Test middleware ordering and failure paths.
[ ] Test DI parameters remain hidden.
[ ] Test task lifecycle, not just task body.
[ ] Run real transport tests for every supported deployment transport.
[ ] Test generated-provider outbound HTTP behavior.
[ ] Run host-level tests for critical Apps.
```

# FastMCP Advanced — 31) Ecosystem and host integrations
### Ecosystem and host integrations

**FastMCP 4 status.** Host compatibility now includes protocol-era negotiation and support for modern input-required loops/extensions. Do not infer feature support solely from basic MCP connectivity.


### 31.0 Integration stance

FastMCP implements MCP server/client capabilities, but the **host decides which MCP capabilities are actually surfaced to the user/model**. A server that is valid MCP can behave differently across Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Goose, ChatGPT, custom clients, or agent frameworks because hosts differ in transport support, Apps rendering, elicitation, sampling, roots, auth UX, and catalog handling.

Therefore document two things separately:

```text
FastMCP capability
vs
Target host capability
```

Never infer host support from FastMCP support alone.

---

## 31.1 Host integration matrix: questions to answer

For every target host, record:

| Dimension | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Transport | STDIO, Streamable HTTP, both? |
| Auth | OAuth/DCR/CIMD/bearer UX supported? |
| Apps | MCP Apps renderer supported? |
| Elicitation | v3 client-mediated elicitation supported? |
| Sampling | Can server request model sampling in the v3 protocol era? |
| Roots | Does the client expose roots? |
| Tasks | Does the client understand task semantics you rely on? |
| Tool count | Does it ingest the entire catalog well? |
| Resources/prompts | Are non-tool component types surfaced? |
| Logging/progress | Are notifications displayed usefully? |

Pin those answers to a host version where possible because client capabilities evolve independently of FastMCP.

---

## 31.2 Claude Desktop / Claude Code

Common patterns:

* local STDIO servers launched as subprocesses;
* remote HTTP servers for centralized deployments;
* configuration/installation via client-specific MCP mechanisms;
* server dependencies must be explicit because host-launched processes may not inherit your development virtual environment.

FastMCP CLI provides install/discovery helpers for both environments. Prefer explicit portable config/commands rather than hand-editing opaque launcher strings repeatedly.

### Claude Code and agent workflows

`fastmcp generate-cli` can emit `SKILL.md`, which can be useful when a coding agent should operate through a generated CLI rather than dynamically inspecting MCP on every turn. This is complementary to direct MCP integration, not a replacement for it.

---

## 31.3 Cursor

Cursor commonly consumes MCP server configuration at the workspace/user level. Practical concerns:

* working-directory-relative paths;
* correct Python/uv environment;
* STDIO command quoting;
* remote URL/auth support;
* tool catalog size.

For large generated catalogs, ToolSearch or Code Mode can be more important than in small demo servers because IDE agents already carry substantial code context and benefit from not injecting hundreds of tool schemas up front.

---

## 31.4 Gemini CLI

Treat Gemini CLI like any other MCP host: verify the actual transport/auth/capability surface rather than relying on server assumptions. FastMCP's CLI can discover/install configurations for supported versions, which makes it practical to test the same server across multiple hosts using one project artifact.

---

## 31.5 Goose

Goose is a useful target for Apps testing because it supports interactive app workflows in documented FastMCP examples. Still test the exact app/provider features you use—especially file upload, approval/choice, and custom renderer behavior—rather than assuming one rendered demo proves complete Apps compatibility.

---

## 31.6 ChatGPT and remote MCP

For remote-host integrations, the decisive requirements are usually:

```text
public/reachable HTTPS URL
correct Streamable HTTP path
OAuth/auth metadata if protected
stable certificate/proxy routing
client-compatible component catalog
```

Do not expose a local development server directly to the Internet merely to make a host reach it. Put the service behind an intentional deployment boundary with authentication, TLS, logging, rate limits, and network policy.

---

## 31.7 Generic MCP JSON configuration

When a client is not directly supported by FastMCP's install helper, generate or hand off standard MCP configuration rather than embedding host-specific assumptions into server code.

Separation:

```text
server.py / package        -> server implementation
fastmcp.json               -> FastMCP project/deployment contract
mcp.json / host config     -> how a particular MCP host launches/connects
```

Do not make server business code read Cursor/Claude/Gemini configuration files.

---

## 31.8 FastAPI integration

FastAPI appears in two ecosystem roles:

1. **source**: `FastMCP.from_fastapi(app)` generates MCP components from FastAPI/OpenAPI;
2. **host web framework**: mount `mcp.http_app()` into a FastAPI application.

These are deliberately distinct. Section 26 covers generation; Sections 19–20 cover mounting/lifespan/reverse-proxy deployment.

---

## 31.9 Agent-framework integration

FastMCP's `Client` is a deterministic MCP consumer and is often the best integration boundary for higher-level agents. Framework code can:

```python
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client("https://example.com/mcp") as client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    result = await client.call_tool("search", {"query": "..."})
```

This preserves control over:

* session lifecycle;
* retries/timeouts;
* auth;
* handler wiring;
* result parsing;
* orchestration policy.

If an agent framework already has native MCP support, decide whether to use that integration or FastMCP Client based on the needed auth/transport/handler feature set. Avoid stacking two MCP client abstractions unless one intentionally wraps the other.

---

## 31.10 OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini model APIs and sampling

FastMCP v3 supports server-initiated sampling through the connected MCP client when the client exposes that capability. This is **not the same** as calling an LLM provider SDK directly inside your tool.

```text
ctx.sample(...)
  -> asks the connected MCP client to perform model sampling

provider_sdk.chat(...)
  -> server itself owns provider credentials/model call
```

Choose intentionally:

| Need | Prefer |
| --- | --- |
| Borrow the host's current model/context | v3 MCP sampling |
| Server owns a fixed model/provider/credential | provider SDK in server |
| Deterministic business action | neither; ordinary code/tool |

FastMCP 4's modern sessionless protocol removes server-initiated sampling on modern connections; this is a major migration decision covered in Section 36.

---

## 31.11 Pydantic AI and other Python agent frameworks

The general integration pattern is to use MCP as an external capability boundary and keep framework-specific agent state outside the FastMCP server unless the server genuinely owns that state.

Avoid:

* leaking framework-internal conversation objects into tool schemas;
* coupling server startup to one agent framework unnecessarily;
* returning provider-specific response objects directly from tools without explicit serialization.

Prefer plain typed Python models at the MCP boundary.

---

## 31.12 Filesystem / skills providers as ecosystem adapters

Provider abstractions let FastMCP treat filesystem content, remote MCP servers, skills, OpenAPI APIs, and custom dynamic catalogs as **sources** rather than hardcoded local decorators.

This makes an integration architecture compositional:

```text
local business tools
+ remote finance MCP proxy
+ filesystem docs provider
+ skills provider
+ OpenAPI provider
  -> transforms/namespaces
  -> one curated server surface
```

Every added provider expands the trust boundary. Apply namespacing, auth, visibility, and failure isolation deliberately.

---

## 31.13 Remote bridges and protocol translation

Use `fastmcp-remote` when a client only knows how to spawn STDIO but the actual server is remote HTTP. Use a programmatic `Client` when your Python code consumes MCP itself. Use a FastMCP proxy/gateway when you want to **republish** a remote MCP surface as part of another server.

Do not conflate:

```text
remote bridge = transport adaptation for a client
Client        = programmatic consumer
proxy server  = republished server surface
```

---

## 31.14 Capability negotiation strategy

For optional client features, fail gracefully:

```text
client supports feature -> use richer interaction
client lacks feature     -> return a plain fallback or reject clearly
```

Examples:

* Apps -> structured/plain text fallback where practical;
* elicitation -> require all fields up front if client cannot elicit;
* sampling -> use configured server model or disable feature if no sampling handler;
* roots -> accept explicit path/resource parameters if roots unavailable.

Do not silently produce incorrect behavior just to avoid a capability error.

---

## 31.15 Cross-host acceptance suite

For every supported host:

```text
[ ] connect / initialize
[ ] list tools/resources/prompts
[ ] call simple typed tool
[ ] structured output rendered/returned correctly
[ ] auth flow succeeds
[ ] long response / streaming works
[ ] progress/log behavior acceptable
[ ] elicitation/sampling/roots tested if required
[ ] Apps render and backend calls work if required
[ ] restart/reconnect behavior acceptable
[ ] tool catalog size remains usable
```

Store the host name/version in test results.

---

## 31.16 Anti-pattern inventory

* “FastMCP supports it, therefore every MCP host supports it.”
* Host-specific config logic inside business tools.
* Assuming the host inherits your shell virtualenv.
* Requiring Apps without a non-App compatibility story when multiple hosts are supported.
* Requiring sampling without testing the client handler/capability.
* Exposing hundreds of tools to an IDE agent without catalog strategy.
* Using a transport bridge when what you actually need is a proxy server—or vice versa.
* Publishing an unauthenticated Internet endpoint just to satisfy a remote host.

---

## 31.17 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Record supported MCP hosts and versions.
[ ] Record transport/auth/App/elicitation/sampling/roots capability per host.
[ ] Keep host config outside server business logic.
[ ] Declare runtime dependencies for host-launched STDIO servers.
[ ] Test remote HTTP through the real TLS/proxy path.
[ ] Use search/code-mode for large catalogs where host tool loading is expensive.
[ ] Provide fallbacks for optional host capabilities when product requirements allow.
[ ] Distinguish Client, fastmcp-remote, and proxy-server use cases.
[ ] Run a cross-host acceptance suite before claiming interoperability.
```

# FastMCP Advanced — 32) Security hardening and governance
### Security hardening and governance

**FastMCP 4 status.** Add encrypted task snapshots, request-state key rotation, modern-vs-legacy interaction gates, and extension capability checks to the hardening checklist.


### 32.0 Threat-model-first stance

FastMCP provides security primitives; it does not know your business authorization model. A production threat model should separate at least these boundaries:

```text
1. Network/transport boundary
2. MCP authentication boundary
3. Component authorization boundary
4. Publication/discovery boundary
5. Business-action boundary
6. Outbound-provider/proxy boundary
7. File/code/UI execution boundary
8. State/cache/task persistence boundary
```

Security failures often happen when one layer is mistaken for another—for example, using hidden visibility as authorization or using an Approval card as enforcement.

---

## 32.1 Security control map

| Threat/control goal | FastMCP mechanism | Still your responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identify HTTP caller | auth provider / token verification | IdP policy, credentials, tenant model |
| Limit component access | component/server authorization checks | Business roles/ownership rules |
| Hide irrelevant components | visibility/transforms | Do not treat hiding as security |
| Prevent transport spoofing | Host/Origin protection, TLS/proxy config | Correct proxy trust/network ACLs |
| Prevent upstream SSRF | hardened proxy/OpenAPI behavior | Allowlisted origins and argument design |
| Prevent cross-user cache leak | identity-aware cache policy | Include principal/tenant in cache partition |
| Prevent file escape | resource/upload path policy | Storage sandbox, filename normalization |
| Prevent arbitrary model code effect | Code Mode/Generative UI sandbox | Backend-tool auth + sandbox policy |
| Protect long-running state | storage/task backend | Encryption, retention, tenancy, backups |

---

## 32.2 Authentication is HTTP-scoped in v3

FastMCP token/OAuth authentication is relevant to HTTP/SSE request flows. STDIO is normally secured by the local process/launcher/OS boundary.

Implication:

```text
HTTP remote server -> FastMCP auth can authenticate network callers
STDIO child process -> secure executable/config/env/filesystem and host process
```

Do not assume `FastMCP(auth=...)` protects a local STDIO server from a malicious local process that can launch/invoke it.

---

## 32.3 Authentication vs authorization

Authentication answers:

```text
Who is this request?
```

Authorization answers:

```text
May this principal execute/read/render this specific component/action?
```

Use component-level checks (`auth=...`) or centralized middleware/policy for scopes/roles/claims. Inside business actions, enforce object-level ownership too.

Example:

```text
scope says invoices:write
AND invoice.tenant_id == current_principal.tenant_id
AND invoice.status allows transition
```

Scope alone rarely captures object-level business authorization.

---

## 32.4 Visibility is not authorization

Visibility transforms control what gets listed or discovered. They improve UX, token economy, and accidental exposure, but direct invocation must still be rejected when unauthorized.

Test both:

```text
unauthorized user list_tools -> secret tool absent
unauthorized user call secret tool by known name -> denied
```

If the second test succeeds, the system is insecure even if the first test passes.

---

## 32.5 Search/Code Mode is not a security sandbox for the catalog

Search transforms hide the full catalog from the model and expose discovery/execute meta-tools. This is excellent for scale but can create a false sense of safety.

Correct order:

```text
provider/source
  -> authorization/visibility-safe component set
      -> search/indexing transform
          -> model discovery
```

Never index sensitive unauthorized components and rely on the model “not finding them.”

---

## 32.6 HTTP Host/Origin hardening

FastMCP 3.4 added/hardened checks around Host/Origin and proxy deployments in response to DNS rebinding and deployment-compatibility concerns.

Production guidance:

* configure trusted external hostnames explicitly;
* understand what headers your reverse proxy rewrites;
* do not trust arbitrary `X-Forwarded-*` unless requests come from a trusted proxy;
* test the real deployment path, not only direct localhost;
* reject unexpected Origins/Hosts where the deployment model allows;
* use TLS at the public boundary.

A security feature disabled “because nginx made it fail” should be replaced by correct trusted-proxy configuration, not removed reflexively.

---

## 32.7 OAuth discovery and redirect integrity

Mounted OAuth-protected servers need correct root-level `.well-known` discovery and consistent public URLs.

Security invariants:

```text
base_url + mcp_path == actual public MCP URL
issuer metadata matches intended authorization server
redirect/callback URLs are predeclared or tightly validated
.well-known routes are available at standards-required paths
```

Do not derive OAuth redirect destinations from arbitrary untrusted request headers without a trusted-proxy/public-URL policy.

---

## 32.8 CIMD / OAuth client metadata

Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) allow OAuth clients to publish metadata at a URL-like client identifier. FastMCP 3.4.x includes hardening around audience validation and metadata/JWKS retrieval.

Threat model:

```text
untrusted URL metadata fetch -> SSRF / internal network reachability
malicious metadata/JWKS -> identity confusion
bad audience handling -> token accepted for wrong resource
```

Keep metadata/JWKS fetch protections enabled and only relax them through explicit trusted-proxy/network policy.

---

## 32.9 Proxy-provider credential separation

A gateway may have:

1. caller credential for the public FastMCP gateway;
2. gateway service/delegated credential for the upstream MCP server.

Never blindly copy the inbound Authorization header to the upstream target.

Explicit mapping:

```text
validated incoming principal
  -> authorization decision
  -> choose upstream identity strategy
      service token OR scoped token exchange OR delegated credential
```

This prevents confused-deputy behavior and accidental cross-environment credential leakage.

---

## 32.10 OpenAPI/HTTP-provider SSRF

Generated API tools can turn seemingly harmless string parameters into outbound paths/URLs. Defend with:

* fixed/allowlisted upstream origins;
* safe URL joining;
* path normalization;
* forbidden local/link-local ranges where not needed;
* redirect controls;
* allowlisted schemes;
* route exclusions;
* patched FastMCP version;
* adversarial tests.

Treat every provider that performs outbound network fetches as an SSRF boundary.

---

## 32.11 File resources and upload security

For `FileResource`, `DirectoryResource`, filesystem providers, and `FileUpload`:

```text
[ ] absolute/known root
[ ] canonicalize path before access
[ ] reject traversal outside root
[ ] do not trust uploaded filename
[ ] enforce bytes/content limits
[ ] isolate tenants/principals
[ ] avoid following unsafe symlinks when sandboxing matters
[ ] sanitize archive extraction paths
[ ] retention and deletion defined
```

File URI access should never accidentally become “arbitrary filesystem read.”

---

## 32.12 Code Mode security

Code Mode intentionally executes model-generated orchestration code to interact with the server catalog. Its value depends on a sandbox.

Threat model includes:

* filesystem access;
* process spawning;
* network access;
* introspection of secrets/environment;
* resource exhaustion;
* infinite loops;
* bypassing intended tool-level input constraints.

Use the documented sandbox path and keep effectful tool authorization intact. A sandbox constrains the model code environment; it does not authorize backend effects.

---

## 32.13 Generative UI security

Generative UI executes model-authored UI code in isolated browser/server-side sandbox environments. Apply the same principle:

```text
sandbox -> limits arbitrary code effects
backend tool auth -> limits business effects
CSP/permissions -> limits renderer capabilities
```

Do not expose secrets to `structuredContent` just because the renderer is sandboxed; the client still receives that payload.

---

## 32.14 Tool annotations are advisory

`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and similar annotations can improve client UX/routing, but they are not security enforcement.

A destructive tool marked `readOnlyHint=True` remains destructive if its implementation deletes data. Security derives from server behavior and authorization, not metadata honesty.

Still keep annotations accurate because safety-oriented clients may rely on them for confirmation UX.

---

## 32.15 Approval is advisory

The built-in Approval app sends a choice back into the conversation. It does not create an unforgeable approval credential by itself.

For hard approval:

```text
user approves through trusted UI/workflow
  -> server records approval bound to principal + action + object + expiry
      -> destructive tool verifies record atomically
          -> consume/mark approval used
```

Do not implement hard approval as `approved: bool` supplied by the LLM.

---

## 32.16 Caching security

The built-in/typical response cache key may be based on operation and arguments rather than user identity. That is dangerous when results depend on:

* current access token;
* session state;
* tenant;
* per-user resource visibility;
* request headers;
* dynamic authorization.

Correct policy:

```text
public deterministic response -> global cache can be okay
principal-dependent response   -> principal/tenant partition or no shared cache
session-dependent response     -> session partition or no shared cache
```

Add explicit tests where two principals call identical arguments.

---

## 32.17 Session state and storage security

Persistent state backends require:

* tenant/user partitioning;
* serialization validation;
* size limits;
* TTL/retention;
* encryption at rest when sensitive;
* access-control around Redis/Valkey/database backend;
* namespace/version migration discipline.

Do not store raw bearer tokens in generic session state unless the architecture explicitly requires it and the storage boundary is appropriate.

---

## 32.18 Background tasks security

A task ID is not necessarily authorization. On every task read/cancel/result action, preserve the principal/tenant relationship.

For durable workers:

```text
submitted principal/tenant/action
  -> serialized task payload
      -> worker re-establishes authorization context or uses scoped service capability
```

Do not let a task run indefinitely with an overprivileged credential copied from an interactive request.

---

## 32.19 Error masking and information disclosure

Use `mask_error_details=True` on Internet-facing production servers unless detailed error propagation is an explicit product requirement.

Still return intentional user-safe errors (`ToolError` or equivalent) when callers need actionable feedback.

Avoid leaking:

* filesystem paths;
* SQL strings with secrets;
* upstream auth headers;
* stack traces;
* internal hostnames/IPs;
* tenant identifiers across users.

Keep full diagnostics in secured server logs/traces.

---

## 32.20 Logging and telemetry hygiene

Audit logs should answer:

```text
who
called what component/version
when
with which tenant/object identifiers
result status / duration
policy decision
trace/request/task id
```

But avoid logging secrets or full sensitive payloads by default. Structured redaction is better than “remember not to log password fields.”

---

## 32.21 Rate limits and resource limits

Authorization does not prevent resource exhaustion by an authorized client.

Control:

* request rate;
* concurrent calls;
* tool timeout;
* upload size;
* result size;
* pagination size;
* background task quota;
* external API quota;
* sandbox CPU/memory/time;
* provider catalog query limits.

Use rate-limiting middleware plus infrastructure-level limits for defense in depth.

---

## 32.22 Dependency and release security

FastMCP's protocol surface evolves quickly and security fixes have shipped throughout 3.x. Production rules:

```text
[ ] pin FastMCP exact stable version
[ ] monitor FastMCP/GitHub security advisories
[ ] update lockfile intentionally
[ ] run contract/security tests on patch/minor upgrades
[ ] pin Prefab for Apps
[ ] patch upstream dependencies and auth libraries
```

Do not run a stale minor just because “the API still works.”

---

## 32.23 Threat matrix

| Threat | Example | Primary control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unauthorized tool call | user guesses hidden admin tool name | auth check + object-level authorization |
| Catalog disclosure | user lists internal tools | visibility + authorization filtering |
| SSRF | generated OpenAPI URL hits metadata service | origin/network controls + patched provider |
| DNS rebinding | hostile Host routes browser/local server | Host/Origin protection |
| Cross-user cache | same args returns another user's data | identity partition / no shared cache |
| Path traversal | uploaded `../../secret` | canonicalized root + generated storage key |
| Code escape | Code Mode arbitrary Python | sandbox + backend authorization |
| UI privilege escalation | app calls hidden destructive backend | backend auth; app visibility not enough |
| OAuth confusion | token audience for wrong resource accepted | issuer/audience verification |
| Task theft | guessed task ID retrieves result | task ownership enforcement |

---

## 32.24 Security acceptance checklist

```text
[ ] Threat model each provider and transport.
[ ] Authenticate all remote production callers unless endpoint is intentionally public.
[ ] Enforce authorization on direct access, not only listing visibility.
[ ] Verify object/tenant ownership in business logic.
[ ] Keep Host/Origin and SSRF protections enabled/configured.
[ ] Use exact public URLs for OAuth discovery/redirects.
[ ] Separate inbound caller credentials from upstream credentials.
[ ] Constrain OpenAPI/proxy origins and redirects.
[ ] Sandboxed model code never receives server secrets unnecessarily.
[ ] File access is rooted, canonicalized, size-limited, tenant-isolated.
[ ] Approval UX is not treated as authorization.
[ ] Identity-dependent cache entries are partitioned.
[ ] Persistent session/task stores have ACL/TTL/encryption policy.
[ ] Error responses do not leak internals.
[ ] Logs are auditable and redacted.
[ ] Rate/concurrency/result/task quotas are defined.
[ ] FastMCP/security dependencies are pinned and monitored.
```

# FastMCP Advanced — 33) Performance, scaling, resilience, and large-catalog engineering
### Performance, scaling, resilience, and large-catalog engineering

**FastMCP 4 status.** Sessionless modern requests simplify ordinary load balancing; durable session state, response caches, task queues, and request-state signing keys remain shared-infrastructure concerns when behavior spans requests/replicas.


### 33.0 Performance model

FastMCP overhead can come from several distinct places:

```text
startup/import
  + component discovery/schema generation
  + provider listing/remote calls
  + middleware/auth
  + transport/serialization
  + tool execution
  + result serialization
  + task/state/cache storage
  + LLM token cost of the published catalog
```

Do not optimize “FastMCP” as one black box. Measure which layer dominates.

---

## 33.1 Startup and import cost

Large servers can spend meaningful time importing:

* SDK clients;
* database libraries;
* ML models;
* hundreds of component modules;
* auth-provider dependencies;
* Prefab/app packages.

Mitigation:

```text
cheap module import
  -> FastMCP construction
      -> shared expensive initialization in lifespan
```

Do not connect to databases or load large models at module import unless the launcher lifecycle truly requires it. Use lifespan so startup/teardown is explicit and testable.

---

## 33.2 `fastmcp-slim` for narrower dependency footprints

FastMCP 3.3 split the importable implementation into `fastmcp-slim`, while the `fastmcp` distribution remains the normal full package. Client-framework authors can use `fastmcp-slim[client]` to avoid pulling in unnecessary server/CLI surface.

Use the full `fastmcp` package by default for ordinary application servers. Use slim packaging when dependency footprint itself is a design constraint and your tests prove the selected extras cover the runtime surface.

---

## 33.3 Sync tool execution and threadpool dispatch

Normal synchronous tools are dispatched so they do not block the event loop.

```python
@mcp.tool
def cpu_light_library_call(x: int) -> int:
    return sync_library(x)
```

For thread-affine libraries FastMCP 3.3 added `run_in_thread=False`:

```python
@mcp.tool(run_in_thread=False)
def thread_affine_operation() -> str:
    return call_library_bound_to_event_loop_thread()
```

This runs inline on the event-loop thread.

Tradeoff:

```text
run_in_thread=True/default -> avoids event-loop blocking, but changes thread
run_in_thread=False        -> preserves thread affinity, blocks every other request while running
```

Use inline sync mode only for short thread-affine operations. It is not a general performance optimization.

### Timeout caveat

Inline sync execution has no cooperative cancellation checkpoints. Do not combine `run_in_thread=False` with assumptions that a FastMCP foreground timeout can interrupt a long blocking sync call.

---

## 33.4 Async tools for I/O concurrency

Prefer `async def` when using async-native clients:

```python
@mcp.tool
async def fetch_customer(customer_id: str) -> dict:
    return await db.fetch_customer(customer_id)
```

Avoid wrapping an async client in synchronous blocking adapters just to keep a `def` signature. Conversely, do not convert CPU-bound pure Python work to `async def` and expect it to become parallel.

For heavy CPU work:

* move to a process pool/native extension/service;
* or run as a background task with appropriate worker resources.

---

## 33.5 Tool catalog token cost

A large tool catalog creates two costs:

1. server/client listing and schema serialization;
2. LLM context/token/selection overhead.

Once catalogs reach hundreds or thousands of tools, the second cost often dominates user experience.

FastMCP 3.1's Tool Search transforms exist specifically for this case.

---

## 33.6 Tool Search

Conceptual architecture:

```text
1000 real tools
  -> search transform
      model initially sees:
        search_tools(...)
        execute_tool(...)
        perhaps schema/details helper
```

The model discovers only candidates relevant to the request rather than ingesting every full schema.

Use when:

* OpenAPI-generated catalogs are large;
* many mounted/remote providers are aggregated;
* tool names/descriptions are searchable;
* model tool selection degrades with raw catalog size.

Do not use search to compensate for poor names/descriptions; search quality depends on the metadata being meaningful.

---

## 33.7 Code Mode

Code Mode goes further by letting the model write small orchestration code that searches/loads/executes components through a sandbox.

Value:

* fewer model round-trips for multi-tool workflows;
* dynamic composition of many safe tools;
* reduces up-front schema injection.

Costs:

* sandbox execution overhead;
* more complex security posture;
* need to test orchestration/failure semantics;
* harder observability if code and tool traces are not correlated.

Use when the workload benefits from programmatic composition—not merely because the catalog is large.

---

## 33.8 Pagination

`list_page_size` controls protocol list pagination. Use it when raw lists can be large even if a search transform is not used.

Tradeoff:

```text
small page -> less per-response memory/token, more round trips
large page -> fewer round trips, larger response and client work
```

Choose based on client behavior and catalog size. Do not set an arbitrary tiny page size without testing clients that automatically enumerate the full catalog anyway.

---

## 33.9 Provider latency

Provider listing can require filesystem/remote/OpenAPI/custom work. Avoid providers that perform expensive full scans on every `list_tools()` without caching/indexing.

Provider optimization strategies:

* precompute stable metadata at startup;
* incremental refresh/index;
* memoize immutable schema descriptions;
* use provider-local caches with clear invalidation;
* set timeouts on remote provider calls;
* isolate slow providers behind gateways/search.

Do not cache principal-dependent provider results globally unless the cache is identity-partitioned.

---

## 33.10 Remote proxy fan-out

A gateway mounting several remote MCP servers can turn one list/call into multiple network operations.

Design for:

```text
per-upstream timeout
circuit breaker / failure isolation
clear namespace
bounded retries
partial catalog policy
health status
```

FastMCP 3.4 changed proxy initialization to fail loudly rather than silently masking an unavailable upstream. Treat that as a feature: startup/readiness should reveal a dependency failure unless your architecture explicitly supports degraded mode.

---

## 33.11 Client connection reuse

A programmatic `Client` owns a session/transport lifecycle. Avoid recreating a remote client for every small operation when a shared initialized session is safe and useful.

```python
async with Client(url) as client:
    # multiple calls share one initialized lifecycle
    ...
```

Use `client.new()` when you need an independent session with the same configuration.

Connection reuse is not universally correct: if authentication principal changes, construct a distinct client/session/cache partition.

---

## 33.12 Stateful vs stateless HTTP scaling

Stateful Streamable HTTP keeps server-side session semantics. It can complicate horizontal scaling because consecutive requests must reach compatible session state.

Stateless HTTP removes that affinity requirement and is usually better for multi-worker/load-balanced deployments when the application does not rely on stateful MCP-session features.

Decision:

| Requirement | Prefer |
| --- | --- |
| elicitation/sampling/session-coupled v3 features | stateful HTTP |
| simple stateless tool API at high scale | stateless HTTP |
| durable app/user state across replicas | explicit shared store, not process memory |

Do not assume cookie sticky sessions solve MCP affinity reliably for every client.

---

## 33.13 Shared state/store latency

Persistent `session_state_store`, task backends, caches, and event stores can add a network round trip to each operation.

Optimization rules:

* store coarse-grained state, not every trivial local variable;
* batch writes where safe;
* choose Redis/Valkey/database locality near workers;
* use TTLs;
* avoid huge serialized blobs;
* separate hot task metadata from bulk artifacts.

Measure backend p95/p99 separately from tool execution.

---

## 33.14 Background tasks and worker scaling

Use tasks when work is long enough that keeping an interactive request open is undesirable.

Scaling model:

```text
MCP frontend replicas
  -> shared Docket/task backend
      -> N workers
          -> shared result/progress backend
```

For multi-process durability, use a shared backend rather than the default in-memory process-local configuration.

Capacity dimensions:

* task queue depth;
* worker concurrency;
* per-task memory/CPU;
* external API quotas;
* cancellation latency;
* result retention.

---

## 33.15 Middleware overhead

Every middleware layer wraps many or all operations. Avoid expensive work in a broad `on_message` hook if it is only needed for tool calls.

Prefer the narrowest hook:

```text
all messages -> request -> call_tool -> specific component
```

Move expensive logging serialization off the critical path when possible. Sample high-volume traces rather than logging full payloads on every request.

---

## 33.16 Caching

Cache only where semantics permit.

Good candidates:

* immutable public resource;
* expensive deterministic metadata lookup;
* public read-only API response with explicit freshness window.

Bad default candidates:

* session state;
* authorization-sensitive response;
* personalized resource;
* destructive mutation result;
* rapidly changing operational data.

A fast wrong/cross-user response is worse than an uncached correct response.

---

## 33.17 Schema dereferencing cost

FastMCP normally dereferences JSON Schema `$ref` structures for client compatibility. Deep/large Pydantic schemas can become verbose.

Mitigation:

* keep MCP-facing models narrow;
* avoid exposing giant internal domain models directly;
* use facade request/response models;
* consider whether every nested field belongs in the tool contract.

Do not disable dereferencing purely for size unless every target client is verified to handle referenced schemas correctly.

---

## 33.18 Result size and streaming

MCP tool results are not a substitute for a bulk data plane. For very large datasets:

* return a resource URI/object reference;
* stream/export to object storage;
* paginate;
* summarize + provide drill-down tools;
* avoid multi-megabyte JSON tool results by default.

The LLM often needs a decision-relevant subset, not the full raw dataset.

---

## 33.19 HTTP reverse-proxy buffering

Streamable HTTP responses may rely on streaming/SSE behavior under the hood. Reverse proxies can destroy latency characteristics by buffering.

Production proxy policy commonly includes:

```text
proxy buffering off for MCP streaming route
long enough read/send timeouts
HTTP keepalive
request/body size limits
TLS termination
```

Test time-to-first-event and long-running response behavior through the actual load balancer.

---

## 33.20 Observability for performance work

Measure:

```text
startup seconds
component-list latency
provider-list latency
schema bytes / tool count
call p50/p95/p99
middleware/auth time
upstream HTTP time
serialization bytes/time
task queue wait + run time
state/cache backend time
open connections / workers
error/timeout/cancel rate
```

Use OpenTelemetry spans plus application metrics. Do not infer bottlenecks from end-to-end duration only.

---

## 33.21 Large-catalog architecture pattern

```text
remote/generated providers
  -> provider-local namespace/curation
  -> authorization-safe server aggregation
  -> ToolSearch or CodeMode
  -> small discovery surface to model
  -> execute selected component
```

This pattern keeps the source catalog broad without forcing the model to ingest it all.

---

## 33.22 Performance anti-patterns

* 2,000 raw model-visible tools with no search strategy.
* Running a blocking 5-second sync function with `run_in_thread=False`.
* Reconnecting a remote client for every operation.
* Full provider rescans on every tool listing.
* Global caching of user-dependent results.
* Process-local state in a horizontally scaled deployment.
* One frontend process executing hour-long background work inline.
* Huge internal Pydantic models exposed directly as tool schemas.
* Multi-megabyte tool results sent to the model instead of a resource/export path.
* Benchmarking direct localhost while production proxy buffers streams.

---

## 33.23 Agent checklist

```text
[ ] Measure startup, catalog, call, provider, state, and task latency separately.
[ ] Use lifespan for shared expensive initialization.
[ ] Prefer async for async I/O.
[ ] Use run_in_thread=False only for short thread-affine sync work.
[ ] Introduce ToolSearch/Code Mode for large catalogs deliberately.
[ ] Use pagination where raw listing remains large.
[ ] Cache provider metadata safely and with invalidation.
[ ] Give remote upstreams timeouts/failure isolation.
[ ] Reuse Client sessions when principal/session semantics allow.
[ ] Choose stateful vs stateless HTTP intentionally.
[ ] Use shared durable backends for scaled tasks/state.
[ ] Keep middleware hooks narrow.
[ ] Bound result/schema sizes.
[ ] Test streaming through the real reverse proxy.
[ ] Instrument with OTEL + service metrics.
```

# FastMCP Advanced — 34) Production architecture patterns
### Production architecture patterns

**FastMCP 4 status.** Production patterns should explicitly choose between stateless modern workflows, authenticated `UserSession`/`SessionId` state, guard-style request state, and legacy-era pinning only when unavoidable.


### 34.0 Pattern catalog

FastMCP is flexible enough that “how do I deploy it?” has no single answer. The useful unit is a production pattern with explicit answers for:

```text
transport
process ownership
state lifetime
auth boundary
provider topology
catalog strategy
long-running work
observability
failure mode
```

The following patterns are reference architectures, not mandatory templates.

---

## 34.1 Pattern A — local desktop/IDE STDIO server

```text
MCP host (Claude/Cursor/etc.)
  -> spawns Python process
      -> FastMCP STDIO
          -> local tools/resources
```

Use for:

* developer tools;
* local filesystem/repository access;
* single-user desktop workflows;
* tools that should inherit the user's local OS permissions.

Recommended:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # STDIO
```

Controls:

* explicit dependency environment (`uv`/install config);
* no stdout logging;
* minimal local filesystem scope;
* local secret handling through environment/OS keychain;
* avoid remote-server auth assumptions.

Failure mode: host cannot launch/import the subprocess because its environment differs from your shell.

---

## 34.2 Pattern B — internal shared Streamable HTTP service

```text
multiple MCP clients
  -> internal HTTPS/load balancer
      -> FastMCP HTTP service
          -> DB/internal APIs
```

Use for shared team services where centralized deployment and common data access matter.

Recommended:

* `mcp.http_app()` under Uvicorn/ASGI;
* authentication even on “internal” networks when data is sensitive;
* stateless HTTP if session features are unnecessary and horizontal scaling is desired;
* shared DB/service pools in lifespan;
* OTEL and request metrics;
* rate/concurrency limits.

---

## 34.3 Pattern C — authenticated enterprise multi-tenant service

```text
MCP client
 -> OAuth/OIDC
    -> edge / reverse proxy
       -> FastMCP auth + authorization
          -> tenant-aware providers/services
             -> enterprise systems
```

Required design decisions:

```text
principal identity key
 tenant id source
 per-tenant authorization
 state/cache partition
 upstream credential strategy
 audit schema
 data retention
```

Avoid one shared `SessionContext`-style mutable global containing tenant secrets. In FastMCP terms, use injected current principal/token plus tenant-aware service dependencies and persistent stores keyed by trusted identity.

---

## 34.4 Pattern D — remote MCP gateway / aggregator

```text
client
 -> one FastMCP gateway
      + local tools
      + remote MCP provider A
      + remote MCP provider B
      + OpenAPI provider C
        -> namespaces/transforms
        -> auth/visibility
        -> search transform
```

Use when clients should integrate once while the platform team manages multiple sources.

Controls:

* namespace every source deliberately;
* fail-loud/readiness policy for upstream initialization;
* timeout/circuit-break each upstream;
* do not forward caller credentials blindly;
* authorize the final published surface;
* ToolSearch/Code Mode for very large aggregate catalogs;
* distributed traces across gateway/upstream calls.

---

## 34.5 Pattern E — generated OpenAPI adapter behind curated facade

```text
OpenAPIProvider (low-level generated operations)
  -> hidden/namespaced
  -> hand-authored workflow tools
      -> model-visible business API
```

Use when an existing REST API is broad/implementation-oriented.

Benefits:

* fast initial integration;
* direct access remains available for controlled maintenance/debug;
* model sees stable business workflows;
* REST refactors do not necessarily break MCP contract.

The facade should own transaction semantics, object authorization, and error normalization.

---

## 34.6 Pattern F — large catalog with Tool Search

```text
hundreds/thousands of safe tools
  -> Search transform
      model sees search + execute surface
```

Use when token/tool-selection cost is the problem and workflows remain naturally discrete tool calls.

Requirements:

* high-quality names/descriptions/tags;
* deterministic search tests;
* authorization before indexing/execution;
* schema-fetch/details flow if needed.

Do not keep both the giant raw catalog and the search meta-tools model-visible unless there is a clear reason.

---

## 34.7 Pattern G — Code Mode orchestration platform

```text
curated safe tool universe
  -> CodeMode sandbox
      -> model writes orchestration code
          -> search/schema/execute components
```

Use when a model frequently needs to combine many small operations and explicit tool-call round trips become inefficient.

Required:

* sandbox with resource/network/filesystem limits;
* effectful backend auth;
* code/tool trace correlation;
* execution time/memory limits;
* deterministic fallback for sandbox errors.

Do not expose raw server secrets/environment to the sandbox.

---

## 34.8 Pattern H — long-running task service

```text
MCP frontend
  -> submit task
      -> shared queue/backend
          -> task workers
              -> progress/result store
```

Use for:

* report generation;
* ETL/indexing;
* long external jobs;
* batch analysis;
* model/document processing.

Production:

* `fastmcp[tasks]` in v3;
* Redis/Valkey/shared Docket backend;
* worker process lifecycle separate from web frontend;
* result TTL;
* cancellation policy;
* task ownership authorization;
* progress throttling.

---

## 34.9 Pattern I — interactive Apps server

```text
MCP host with Apps support
 -> model calls app entry tool
    -> renderer iframe
       -> app-only backend tools
          -> server services/state
```

Use for dashboards, forms, file upload, approvals, or human-in-the-loop work surfaces.

Production:

* pin Prefab;
* app/model visibility discipline;
* CSP/permissions for custom HTML;
* real host acceptance tests;
* persistent file/state scope for stateless/scaled deployments;
* server-side enforcement behind approval UI.

---

## 34.10 Pattern J — hybrid FastAPI + MCP service

```text
one ASGI process
  /api/* -> FastAPI REST
  /mcp/* -> FastMCP http_app
```

Use when the same service/product exposes both conventional HTTP APIs and MCP.

Required:

* compose/forward lifespans correctly;
* keep REST auth and MCP auth semantics explicit;
* share pools through application/lifespan state carefully;
* avoid path/base-URL confusion;
* route `.well-known` correctly for OAuth;
* independently rate-limit REST and MCP workloads if needed.

---

## 34.11 Pattern K — serverless/stateless MCP

Use only if your required MCP features tolerate stateless requests.

```text
client
 -> stateless HTTP request
    -> ephemeral worker
       -> shared DB/object/state backends
```

Good fit:

* short independent tools;
* shared durable business state already externalized;
* no dependence on process-local session objects.

Poor fit:

* v3 interactive features requiring persistent session callback semantics;
* in-memory FileUpload scope;
* process-local task backends;
* expensive per-request startup.

---

## 34.12 Pattern L — high-security brokered service

```text
public client
 -> OAuth resource server
    -> policy gateway
       -> narrow FastMCP catalog
          -> credential broker
             -> protected upstream systems
```

Use when upstream systems must never receive raw client credentials or when every action needs centrally audited policy.

Controls:

* strong issuer/audience verification;
* short-lived scoped upstream credentials;
* allowlisted tools/actions;
* object-level authorization;
* immutable audit trail;
* error masking;
* no arbitrary proxy/OpenAPI origins;
* egress network policy.

---

## 34.13 Context/state ownership by architecture

| Pattern | Process-local state acceptable? | Shared store needed? |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| local STDIO | often | only for durability |
| single-instance HTTP | sometimes | for restart durability |
| multi-worker stateless HTTP | no for cross-request features | yes |
| task service | no for durable/distributed tasks | yes |
| multi-tenant SaaS | only request-local | yes for session/business state |
| FileUpload in stateless HTTP | no | durable/user-keyed file store |

---

## 34.14 Auth ownership by architecture

```text
Local STDIO:
  OS/user/launcher boundary

Remote HTTP:
  FastMCP auth + authorization

Gateway:
  inbound auth != outbound upstream credential

Hybrid FastAPI:
  REST auth and MCP auth may share IdP but are separate request surfaces
```

Document which layer validates token issuer/audience and which code decides component/object permissions.

---

## 34.15 Deployment readiness checklist

```text
[ ] Exact FastMCP version pinned.
[ ] Python/dependency lockfile reproducible.
[ ] Server name/version/instructions explicit.
[ ] Transport and public path documented.
[ ] Lifespan initializes/tears down all shared resources.
[ ] Auth/authorization tests cover direct access.
[ ] Host/Origin/proxy/TLS settings tested in production topology.
[ ] `.well-known` OAuth routing correct if applicable.
[ ] Catalog size strategy selected.
[ ] Persistent state/task/cache backend selected where needed.
[ ] Result/file/upload size limits configured.
[ ] Reverse proxy does not buffer streaming unexpectedly.
[ ] OTEL/logging/metrics include request/tool/task identifiers.
[ ] Contract manifest/fingerprints stored.
[ ] Rollback version and data/schema compatibility known.
```

---

## 34.16 Failure-mode planning

For every external dependency, define behavior:

| Dependency | Fail-closed? | Degraded mode? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| auth/JWKS | normally fail closed | cached validated keys only under defined policy |
| remote provider | often readiness failure | optional provider may be omitted if product allows |
| DB | tool failure / readiness | read-only cache if semantically safe |
| task backend | reject new long tasks | foreground fallback only if bounded/safe |
| telemetry | should not break business path | buffer/drop according to policy |
| Apps renderer CDN/assets | plain response or explicit app error | depends on product UX |

Do not let an observability outage become an authorization bypass or a remote-provider outage silently expose stale/incorrect capabilities.

---

## 34.17 Anti-pattern inventory

* One architecture accidentally serving local STDIO, public HTTP, tasks, Apps, and multi-tenancy without explicit boundaries.
* Process-memory session/file/task state behind multiple workers.
* Gateway forwarding inbound bearer tokens directly to every upstream.
* Large OpenAPI catalog published raw to the model.
* Long tasks running inside web request workers.
* Hybrid FastAPI mounting without lifespan propagation.
* Multi-tenant cache without tenant partitioning.
* Production Apps with floating Prefab dependency.
* Serverless deployment of session-dependent v3 workflows.

---

## 34.18 Agent architecture questionnaire

```text
1. Who launches/owns the server process?
2. Which transport(s) are required?
3. Is the server local-user or remote multi-user?
4. Which auth principal and tenant model applies?
5. Which components/providers are public?
6. How large is the catalog?
7. Does the workflow require session callbacks or Apps?
8. Can requests be stateless?
9. Which state must survive process restart?
10. Which jobs exceed normal request duration?
11. Which upstream credentials are used and how are they derived?
12. What are the file/network/code sandbox boundaries?
13. How are contract changes detected?
14. What is the failure/degraded-mode policy for each dependency?
15. What telemetry proves correctness and performance?
```

# FastMCP Advanced — 35) API stability, upgrade discipline, and FastMCP 3 → 4 migration

## 35.0 Upgrade posture

FastMCP 4.0.0 is GA. Most v3 applications upgrade with limited code changes, but the cases that relied on session callbacks, v3 task APIs, deprecated aliases, or raw SDK objects need an architectural migration. ([Upgrade][1])

## 35.1 Environment floor

Before code changes, resolve dependency constraints:

```text
FastMCP 4 -> Pydantic >= 2.12
server extra -> Starlette >= 1.0.1
FastAPI mounting -> use FastAPI >= 0.133.0 (or another proven Starlette-1.x-compatible release)
```

## 35.2 MCP SDK v2 field migration

Python model fields are snake_case while wire aliases remain camelCase. FastMCP's `mcp_camelcase_compat` bridge makes common old reads work temporarily and emits `FastMCPDeprecationWarning`. Turn the bridge off in CI to find remaining old attribute access.

## 35.3 Protocol types

Protocol types live in `mcp_types` and remain re-exported from `mcp.types`. `fastmcp.types` is for FastMCP-specific types, not the general protocol model.

## 35.4 HTTP stack

FastMCP uses `httpx2`, not `httpx`, for its own HTTP stack. Custom transport factories/auth objects/OpenAPI clients passed into FastMCP must migrate to `httpx2`; exception handlers must catch `httpx2` exceptions. Your own unrelated tool-side HTTP code may continue using whatever library you choose.

## 35.5 Removed server callback APIs

Removed:

```text
ctx.sample()
ctx.sample_step()
ctx.list_roots()
FastMCP(sampling_handler=...)
FastMCP(sampling_handler_behavior=...)
```

Use server-owned model clients, explicit tool arguments, or modern guard-return interactions.

## 35.6 Removed/deprecated import and method shims

Permanent homes include:

| Removed v3 location/API | FastMCP 4 replacement |
|---|---|
| `fastmcp.server.proxy` | `fastmcp.server.providers.proxy` |
| `fastmcp.server.openapi` | `fastmcp.server.providers.openapi` / `OpenAPIProvider` |
| `fastmcp.server.apps` / `.app` | `fastmcp.apps` / top-level `FastMCPApp` |
| old component class re-exports | canonical `fastmcp.tools`, `fastmcp.resources`, `fastmcp.prompts` homes |
| `FastMCP.as_proxy(...)` | `create_proxy(...)` |
| `mcp.import_server(...)` | `mcp.mount(...)` (note live/lifecycle semantics differ) |
| `mount(prefix=...)` | `mount(namespace=...)` |
| `mcp.remove_tool(...)` | `mcp.local_provider.remove_tool(...)` |
| `TaskConfig` in `server.tasks` | `fastmcp.utilities.tasks.TaskConfig` |
| Docket deps in `fastmcp.dependencies` | `fastmcp_tasks.dependencies` |

## 35.7 Task migration

Install/register `TasksExtension`. `task=` is tool-only. `client.call_tool(..., task=True)` is removed; use normal `call_tool` for transparent completion or `fastmcp_tasks.call_tool_task` for a handle.

## 35.8 Elicitation migration

`ctx.elicit()` is handshake-era-only. Default `Client(..., mode="auto")` normally negotiates the modern era against a v4 server, where `ctx.elicit()` raises. Migrate to `InputRequiredResult` guards, or temporarily control clients with `mode="legacy"`.

## 35.9 Session migration

Do not expect `ctx.set_state()` from one modern call to appear in the next. Use `UserSession` or `SessionId`/`SessionProvider`, backed by appropriate storage.

## 35.10 Middleware migration

Middleware now observes more inbound traffic. Audit counters, message assumptions, and generic hooks. Operation-specific hooks remain more stable when you only care about one operation type.

## 35.11 Local client target migration

`Client("server.py")` is deprecated; use `Client(Path("server.py"))` or explicit `StdioTransport`. String semantics are converging on URLs in FastMCP 5.

## 35.12 Upgrade gate

```text
[ ] dependencies resolve at v4 floors
[ ] camelCase compat disabled in a CI job
[ ] raw SDK accesses audited for snake_case/v2 signatures
[ ] custom HTTP objects migrated to httpx2
[ ] removed imports/server methods replaced
[ ] server sampling/roots callback assumptions removed
[ ] elicitation ported to guard model where modern clients are supported
[ ] cross-request state ported to UserSession/SessionId/domain storage
[ ] tasks extension registered and client task calls migrated
[ ] middleware generic hooks audited for expanded traffic
[ ] modern and legacy protocol-mode acceptance tests pass
[ ] auth/proxy/security regression suite passes
```

# FastMCP Advanced — 36) FastMCP 4 capability delta and protocol-era matrix

## 36.0 FastMCP 4 is the stable baseline

FastMCP 4.0.0 shipped 2026-08-31. The principal architectural shift is one implementation that can negotiate both the modern `2026-07-28` protocol and earlier handshake-era protocols. Modern requests are sessionless/self-contained, improving ordinary load balancing and serverless compatibility. ([Release][1])

## 36.1 New first-class capabilities

FastMCP 4 adds or elevates:

* multi-round interactive tools (`InputRequiredResult`);
* sealed request state for stateless interaction rounds;
* `UserSession` / `SessionId` application session state;
* server/client extension APIs;
* tasks as the `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension;
* `@mcp.completion` argument completion;
* identity assertion, roles, scope shortfall challenges, client credentials;
* DI `CallArgument`;
* `ClientGroup`;
* distributed client response-cache stores;
* server cache hints;
* MCP method/name gateway routing metadata;
* SDK v2 model field normalization and protocol-type package split.

## 36.2 Era matrix

| Capability | Handshake-era | Modern `2026-07-28` | FastMCP 4 guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| core tools/resources/prompts | yes | yes | normal |
| protocol negotiation | initialize handshake | `server/discover` | `Client(mode="auto")` |
| server `ctx.elicit()` | yes | no | guard result on modern |
| `InputRequiredResult` guard | no | yes | modern interaction primitive |
| server `ctx.sample()` | removed | removed | call server LLM or guard |
| server `ctx.list_roots()` | removed | removed | explicit args or guard |
| context state across calls | session-dependent | no | use session state |
| `UserSession` / `SessionId` | application layer | application layer | v4 cross-request state |
| background tasks extension | not negotiated | yes | modern-only |
| `on_initialize` | runs | no initialize event | don't gate modern auth here |
| `client.set_logging_level` | supported | not sessionful | avoid modern dependence |
| argument completion | supported | supported | `@mcp.completion` |
| extensions | limited/era-specific | negotiated per request | v4 extension API |

## 36.3 Compatibility principle

Prefer code that works in both eras when practical. Pinning clients to legacy is justified only when you control all callers and have not yet ported a required handshake-only capability. For public/uncontrolled MCP clients, design for modern sessionless semantics.

# FastMCP Advanced — 37) Dense appendices and lookup matrices

## A) FastMCP 4 package matrix

| Need | Package / stance |
|---|---|
| normal server + client + CLI | `fastmcp==4.0.0` |
| client-only dependency surface | same-version `fastmcp-slim[client]` |
| background tasks | `fastmcp[tasks]==4.0.0` + `TasksExtension()` |
| Apps | `fastmcp[apps]==4.0.0` plus explicitly tested/pinned UI deps |
| Code Mode | `fastmcp[code-mode]==4.0.0` |
| remote HTTP → local stdio bridge | `fastmcp-remote` |

## B) Protocol model naming

| Wire / old Python field | Current Python field |
|---|---|
| `inputSchema` | `input_schema` |
| `outputSchema` | `output_schema` |
| `structuredContent` | `structured_content` |
| `isError` | `is_error` |
| `mimeType` | `mime_type` |
| `nextCursor` | `next_cursor` |
| `serverInfo` | `server_info` |
| `protocolVersion` | `protocol_version` |

## C) State decision table

| Requirement | Primitive |
|---|---|
| middleware→tool data in one call | Context request state |
| carry small opaque data between guard rounds | `request_state` |
| one bucket per authenticated user | `UserSession` |
| multiple sessions per user | `SessionId` + `SessionProvider` |
| durable business truth | application DB/store |
| background execution status/result | tasks backend |

## D) Interactivity decision table

| Need | Modern | Handshake-era |
|---|---|---|
| user input | return `InputRequiredResult` | `await ctx.elicit(...)` |
| client's model | guard request, if specifically needed | legacy client sampling path; server API methods removed |
| roots/paths | explicit args or guard | explicit args; server Context roots method removed |

## E) Task truth table

| Concern | FastMCP 4 rule |
|---|---|
| component types | tools only |
| function type | async only for task-enabled tools |
| extension | register `TasksExtension()` |
| client ordinary call | `client.call_tool(...)` transparently completes |
| immediate task handle | `fastmcp_tasks.call_tool_task(...)` |
| legacy protocol | runs synchronously / tasks not negotiated |
| scaled backend | Redis/Valkey |
| sensitive snapshot | set `FASTMCP_TASKS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` |

## F) Extension vs middleware vs provider vs transform

| Need | Abstraction |
|---|---|
| source components | Provider |
| rewrite published components | Transform |
| observe/enforce ordinary request policy | Middleware |
| negotiated protocol capability/method/result behavior | Extension |

## G) Client aggregation choices

| Need | Primitive |
|---|---|
| one Python client to one endpoint | `Client` |
| republish remote components behind a server | ProxyProvider / `create_proxy` |
| compose child FastMCP servers in-process | `mount` |
| coordinate independent connections/eras without proxy | `ClientGroup` |
| stdio-only host reaches remote server | `fastmcp-remote` |

## H) Upgrade anti-patterns

* leaving 3.4.7 pins in generated production examples;
* treating `ctx.set_state` as cross-request state on modern connections;
* using `ctx.sample`, `ctx.sample_step`, or `ctx.list_roots`;
* using `client.call_tool(..., task=True)`;
* configuring `task=` on resources/prompts;
* registering a task tool without `TasksExtension`;
* writing new code against camelCase MCP model attributes;
* passing `httpx` objects into FastMCP's v4 HTTP internals;
* assuming `on_initialize` runs on modern connections;
* relying on `ctx.elicit()` when clients negotiate modern by default;
* sharing request-state tokens across replicas without a shared signing key;
* storing task caller tokens in Redis without snapshot encryption;
* treating extension advertisements as implicit authorization.

## I) Production readiness checklist

# FastMCP Advanced — 38) Modern multi-round interaction and request-state guards

## 38.0 The v4 interaction primitive

On the modern protocol a running server cannot suspend and push a request to the client. A tool instead **returns** `InputRequiredResult`; the client answers and calls the tool again. Each leg is an independent request and therefore scales cleanly across serverless workers and replicas. ([Elicitation][1])

## 38.1 Context inputs

`ctx.input_responses` is `None` on the first leg and contains prior answers on later legs. `ctx.request_state` carries small server-minted state between legs. The state is sealed by FastMCP before leaving the server and verified before re-entry.

## 38.2 Client driver

`fastmcp.Client` drives input-required rounds automatically when configured with the needed handler(s). The default `input_required_max_rounds` is 10, preventing an accidental infinite guard loop.

## 38.3 Multi-replica keying

Configure `RequestStateSecurity(keys=[...])` with the same secret key ring on every replica. `keys[0]` seals; the ring can unseal for rotation.

## 38.4 Design invariant

A guard tool must be **re-entrant and replay-aware**: middleware, authorization, and the function body run again every leg. Do not perform irreversible side effects before you know all required input has arrived, unless those side effects are idempotently checkpointed.

# FastMCP Advanced — 39) Server extensions and negotiated capabilities

## 39.0 Extension architecture

FastMCP 4 makes protocol extensions first-class. Subclass `ServerExtension`, use a reverse-DNS identifier, and register with `mcp.add_extension()`. An extension may advertise settings, bind additive request methods, intercept tool calls, and own lifespan resources. ([Extensions][1])

```python
from fastmcp.server.extensions import ServerExtension

class AuditExtension(ServerExtension):
    identifier = "com.example/audit"

mcp.add_extension(AuditExtension())
```

## 39.1 Negotiation is per request

The client repeats extension capabilities in request `_meta`. FastMCP routes the extension but does **not** automatically make every interceptor conditional. Before returning extension-specific semantics, check `context.client_extension_settings(identifier)` / equivalent extension helper.

## 39.2 Additive methods

`MethodBinding` can add extension methods, with Pydantic request-param validation and optional `protocol_versions`. Extensions may not shadow core methods such as `tools/call`; use middleware or tool interception instead.

## 39.3 Tool-call interceptor

`intercept_tool_call()` runs after middleware and immediately before the tool body. Multiple interceptors nest registration-order outermost-first. Use this only for behavior belonging to a negotiated capability.

## 39.4 Extension lifespan and composition

Register extensions before startup. Mounted child extensions do not automatically advertise on the root wire endpoint; register extensions on the server that is actually served.

## 39.5 Client extensions

Pass `ClientExtension` objects through `Client(extensions=[...])`. `advertise()` is appropriate only when the client truly implements/understands the extension's wire behavior.

# FastMCP Advanced — 40) FastMCP 4 session state: UserSession, SessionId, SessionProvider

## 40.0 Why session state moved up a layer

The modern MCP transport is stateless, so persistent application continuity is explicit rather than implicit in a connection. FastMCP provides two patterns: authenticated implicit `UserSession` and explicit `SessionId` plus `SessionProvider`. ([Sessions][1])

## 40.1 `UserSession`

Use one server-side bucket per authenticated user. The parameter is injected and omitted from the public tool schema. This is ideal for preferences, user memory, or one current workflow.

## 40.2 `SessionId`

Use when the same user may hold several workflows. The id appears in the tool schema; `SessionProvider` contributes `create_session` / `end_session`; `get_session()` validates ownership and resolves the server-side bucket.

## 40.3 Security

Authentication supplies the first namespace. With auth, a leaked id alone cannot cross user boundaries. Without auth, session ids are bearer handles and therefore unsuitable as a multi-tenant boundary.

## 40.4 Storage

Use a shared store for multi-replica continuity and configure TTL behavior in the backing key-value layer.

# FastMCP Advanced — 41) Argument completion

## 41.0 Purpose

FastMCP 4 exposes server-side autocomplete for **prompt arguments** and **resource-template parameters** through `completion/complete`. Register one handler with `@mcp.completion`; branch on the `PromptReference` / `ResourceTemplateReference` and argument name. ([Completions][1])

```python
@mcp.completion
def complete(ref, argument, context):
    if is_supported(ref, argument.name):
        return [v for v in candidates if v.startswith(argument.value)]
    return None
```

## 41.1 Completion context

`context.arguments` contains values the user has already supplied, enabling dependent autocomplete (for example, repository choices conditional on owner). The context may be absent before any values are resolved.

## 41.2 Return shapes

Return `list[str]`, `None`, or a `Completion` object. The protocol caps one response at 100 values; `Completion(total=..., has_more=...)` communicates truncation.

## 41.3 Authorization caveat

Completion is connection-authenticated but not automatically governed by a referenced component's per-component `auth=` or visibility rule. If the candidates themselves are sensitive, read auth context inside the completion handler and filter/deny explicitly.

# FastMCP Advanced — 42) Modern identity, roles, scope challenges, and machine-to-machine authentication

## 42.0 Auth model expansion

FastMCP 4 keeps the existing verifier/OAuth/OIDC/MultiAuth architecture and adds richer service/agent identity primitives. Release highlights include identity assertion (SEP-990, beta), provider-neutral role checks, insufficient-scope challenges that name missing scopes, and client-credentials authentication for machine-to-machine callers. ([Release][1])

## 42.1 Roles vs scopes

Use scopes for authorization-server-issued capabilities and roles for provider-neutral application roles when appropriate. FastMCP's authorization helpers include `require_roles` alongside scope-oriented checks. Keep both as authorization checks, not mere visibility tags.

## 42.2 Scope shortfall challenges

When an authenticated caller lacks a scope, v4 can surface an insufficient-scope challenge that identifies the missing scopes, allowing capable clients/auth middleware to request or diagnose the needed permission instead of receiving an opaque denial.

## 42.3 Identity assertion

SEP-990 identity assertion is beta. Treat asserted downstream identity as a signed/validated delegation artifact, not as a caller-supplied user-id string. Review audience, issuer, expiry, and trust-chain policy before using it as a tenant boundary.

## 42.4 Client credentials

Use FastMCP client-credentials auth for non-interactive service→service connections where no browser/interactive login should occur. Scope credentials narrowly and rotate them independently from human OAuth clients.

# FastMCP Advanced — 43) Client groups and multi-server orchestration

## 43.0 Why `ClientGroup` is distinct

A `ClientGroup` coordinates several **independent** FastMCP clients. Each keeps its own transport, authentication, handlers, capabilities, and negotiated protocol era. The group namespaces tool names and routes calls to the owning client. This is different from passing a multi-server config through one aggregated proxy chain. ([ClientGroup][1])

## 43.1 Basic pattern

```python
from fastmcp.client.group import ClientGroup

group = ClientGroup({
    "legacy": legacy_client,
    "modern": modern_client,
})

async with group:
    tools = await group.list_tools()
    result = await group.call_tool("modern_get_weather", {"city": "Chicago"})
```

## 43.2 Provenance-aware adapters

`resolve_tool()` returns the route, including the real owning client and upstream tool name. Agent-framework adapters should use this when per-client multi-round loops, handlers, interceptors, or auth context must stay attached to the actual connection.

## 43.3 Dynamic catalogs

`list_tools()` refreshes routes/catalogs explicitly. Unknown tool names can then fail locally without re-querying every backend.

## 43.4 When to use what

Use `ClientGroup` when you are a **consumer** of several servers and want independent connections. Use a FastMCP proxy/gateway when you need to **republish** a combined MCP server to downstream clients.
