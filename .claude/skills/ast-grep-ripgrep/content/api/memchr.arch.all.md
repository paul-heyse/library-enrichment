## is_equal

`function` · `memchr::arch::all::is_equal`

```rust
fn is_equal(x: &[u8], y: &[u8]) -> bool
```

Compare corresponding bytes in `x` and `y` for equality.

That is, this returns true if and only if `x.len() == y.len()` and
`x[i] == y[i]` for all `0 <= i < x.len()`.

# Inlining

This routine is marked `inline(always)`. If you want to call this function
in a way that is not always inlined, you'll need to wrap a call to it in
another function that is marked as `inline(never)` or just `inline`.

# Motivation

Why not use slice equality instead? Well, slice equality usually results in
a call out to the current platform's `libc` which might not be inlineable
or have other overhead. This routine isn't guaranteed to be a win, but it
might be in some cases.

## is_equal_raw

`function` · `memchr::arch::all::is_equal_raw`

```rust
unsafe fn is_equal_raw(x: *const u8, y: *const u8, n: usize) -> bool
```

Compare `n` bytes at the given pointers for equality.

This returns true if and only if `*x.add(i) == *y.add(i)` for all
`0 <= i < n`.

# Inlining

This routine is marked `inline(always)`. If you want to call this function
in a way that is not always inlined, you'll need to wrap a call to it in
another function that is marked as `inline(never)` or just `inline`.

# Safety

* Both `x` and `y` must be valid for reads of up to `n` bytes.
* Both `x` and `y` must point to an initialized value.
* Both `x` and `y` must each point to an allocated object and
must either be in bounds or at most one byte past the end of the
allocated object. `x` and `y` do not need to point to the same allocated
object, but they may.
* Both `x` and `y` must be _derived from_ a pointer to their respective
allocated objects.
* The distance between `x` and `x+n` must not overflow `isize`. Similarly
for `y` and `y+n`.
* The distance being in bounds must not rely on "wrapping around" the
address space.

## is_prefix

`function` · `memchr::arch::all::is_prefix`

```rust
fn is_prefix(haystack: &[u8], needle: &[u8]) -> bool
```

Returns true if and only if `needle` is a prefix of `haystack`.

This uses a latency optimized variant of `memcmp` internally which *might*
make this faster for very short strings.

in a way that is not always inlined, you'll need to wrap a call to it in
another function that is marked as `inline(never)` or just `inline`.

## is_suffix

`function` · `memchr::arch::all::is_suffix`

```rust
fn is_suffix(haystack: &[u8], needle: &[u8]) -> bool
```

Returns true if and only if `needle` is a suffix of `haystack`.

This uses a latency optimized variant of `memcmp` internally which *might*
make this faster for very short strings.

# Inlining

This routine is marked `inline(always)`. If you want to call this function
in a way that is not always inlined, you'll need to wrap a call to it in
another function that is marked as `inline(never)` or just `inline`.
