A state identifier specifically tailored for lazy DFAs.

A lazy state ID logically represents a pointer to a DFA state. In practice,
by limiting the number of DFA states it can address, it reserves some
bits of its representation to encode some additional information. That
additional information is called a "tag." That tag is used to record
whether the state it points to is an unknown, dead, quit, start or match
state.

When implementing a low level search routine with a lazy DFA, it is
necessary to query the type of the current state to know what to do:

* **Unknown** - The state has not yet been computed. The
parameters used to get this state ID must be re-passed to
[`DFA::next_state`](crate::hybrid::dfa::DFA::next_state), which will never
return an unknown state ID.
* **Dead** - A dead state only has transitions to itself. It indicates that
the search cannot do anything else and should stop with whatever result it
has.
* **Quit** - A quit state indicates that the automaton could not answer
whether a match exists or not. Correct search implementations must return a
[`MatchError::quit`](crate::MatchError::quit) when a DFA enters a quit
state.
* **Start** - A start state is a state in which a search can begin.
Lazy DFAs usually have more than one start state. Branching on
this isn't required for correctness, but a common optimization is
to run a prefilter when a search enters a start state. Note that
start states are *not* tagged automatically, and one must enable the
[`Config::specialize_start_states`](crate::hybrid::dfa::Config::specialize_start_states)
setting for start states to be tagged. The reason for this is
that a DFA search loop is usually written to execute a prefilter once it
enters a start state. But if there is no prefilter, this handling can be
quite disastrous as the DFA may ping-pong between the special handling code
and a possible optimized hot path for handling untagged states. When start
states aren't specialized, then they are untagged and remain in the hot
path.
* **Match** - A match state indicates that a match has been found.
Depending on the semantics of your search implementation, it may either
continue until the end of the haystack or a dead state, or it might quit
and return the match immediately.

As an optimization, the [`is_tagged`](LazyStateID::is_tagged) predicate
can be used to determine if a tag exists at all. This is useful to avoid
branching on all of the above types for every byte searched.

# Example

This example shows how `LazyStateID` can be used to implement a correct
search routine with minimal branching. In particular, this search routine
implements "leftmost" matching, which means that it doesn't immediately
stop once a match is found. Instead, it continues until it reaches a dead
state.

Notice also how a correct search implementation deals with
[`CacheError`](crate::hybrid::CacheError)s returned by some of
the lazy DFA routines. When a `CacheError` occurs, it returns
[`MatchError::gave_up`](crate::MatchError::gave_up).

    // byte), so we don't need to check if the start state is a match.
