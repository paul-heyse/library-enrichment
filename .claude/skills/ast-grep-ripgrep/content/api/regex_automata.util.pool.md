Crate `regex-automata` · 2 public items · structured records in [`model/regex_automata.util.pool.json`](../model/regex_automata.util.pool.json)

## Pool

`struct` · `regex_automata::util::pool::Pool`

```rust
struct Pool<T, F = fn() -> T>
```

**Derives**: Debug

**Methods** (2)

```rust
fn get(&self) -> PoolGuard<'_, T, F>
fn new(create: F) -> Pool<T, F>
```

A thread safe pool that works in an `alloc`-only context.

Getting a value out comes with a guard. When that guard is dropped, the
value is automatically put back in the pool. The guard provides both a
`Deref` and a `DerefMut` implementation for easy access to an underlying
`T`.

A `Pool` impls `Sync` when `T` is `Send` (even if `T` is not `Sync`). This
is possible because a pool is guaranteed to provide a value to exactly one
thread at any time.

Currently, a pool never contracts in size. Its size is proportional to the
maximum number of simultaneous uses. This may change in the future.

A `Pool` is a particularly useful data structure for this crate because
many of the regex engines require a mutable "cache" in order to execute
a search. Since regexes themselves tend to be global, the problem is then:
how do you get a mutable cache to execute a search? You could:

1. Use a `thread_local!`, which requires the standard library and requires
that the regex pattern be statically known.
2. Use a `Pool`.
3. Make the cache an explicit dependency in your code and pass it around.
4. Put the cache state in a `Mutex`, but this means only one search can
execute at a time.
5. Create a new cache for every search.

A `thread_local!` is perhaps the best choice if it works for your use case.
Putting the cache in a mutex or creating a new cache for every search are
perhaps the worst choices. Of the remaining two choices, whether you use
this `Pool` or thread through a cache explicitly in your code is a matter
of taste and depends on your code architecture.

# Warning: may use a spin lock

When this crate is compiled _without_ the `std` feature, then this type
may used a spin lock internally. This can have subtle effects that may
be undesirable. See [Spinlocks Considered Harmful][spinharm] for a more
thorough treatment of this topic.

# Example

This example shows how to share a single hybrid regex among multiple
threads, while also safely getting exclusive access to a hybrid's
[`Cache`](crate::hybrid::regex::Cache) without preventing other searches
from running while your thread uses the `Cache`.

```
use regex_automata::{
    hybrid::regex::{Cache, Regex},
    util::{lazy::Lazy, pool::Pool},
    Match,
};

static RE: Lazy<Regex> =
    Lazy::new(|| Regex::new("foo[0-9]+bar").unwrap());
static CACHE: Lazy<Pool<Cache>> =
    Lazy::new(|| Pool::new(|| RE.create_cache()));

let expected = Some(Match::must(0, 3..14));
assert_eq!(expected, RE.find(&mut CACHE.get(), b"zzzfoo12345barzzz"));
```

## PoolGuard

`struct` · `regex_automata::util::pool::PoolGuard`

```rust
struct PoolGuard<'a, T: Send, F: Fn() -> T>
```

**Implements**: `core::ops::deref::Deref`, `core::ops::deref::DerefMut`

**Derives**: Debug

**Methods** (1)

```rust
fn put(this: PoolGuard<'_, T, F>)
```

**via `core::ops::deref::Deref`**

```rust
fn deref(&self) -> &T
```

**via `core::ops::deref::DerefMut`**

```rust
fn deref_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T
```

A guard that is returned when a caller requests a value from the pool.

The purpose of the guard is to use RAII to automatically put the value
back in the pool once it's dropped.
