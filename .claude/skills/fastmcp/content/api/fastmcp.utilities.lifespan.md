AppT = TypeVar('AppT')
```

**Inferred type** (`ty`, not declared in the source): `TypeVar`

## combine_lifespans

`fastmcp.utilities.lifespan.combine_lifespans`

```python
def combine_lifespans(lifespans: Callable[[AppT], AbstractAsyncContextManager[Mapping[str, Any] | None]] = ()) -> Callable[[AppT], AbstractAsyncContextManager[dict[str, Any]]]
```

Combine multiple lifespans into a single lifespan.

Useful when mounting FastMCP into FastAPI and you need to run
both your app's lifespan and the MCP server's lifespan.

Works with both FastAPI-style lifespans (yield None) and FastMCP-style
lifespans (yield dict). Results are merged; later lifespans override
earlier ones on key conflicts.

Lifespans are entered in order and exited in reverse order (LIFO).

Example:
    ```python
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    from fastmcp.utilities.lifespan import combine_lifespans
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    mcp = FastMCP("Tools")
    mcp_app = mcp.http_app()

    app = FastAPI(lifespan=combine_lifespans(app_lifespan, mcp_app.lifespan))
    app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)  # MCP endpoint at /mcp
    ```

Args:
    *lifespans: Lifespan context manager factories to combine.

Returns:
    A combined lifespan context manager factory.
